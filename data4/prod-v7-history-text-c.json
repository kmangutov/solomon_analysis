Why would I want to know who paid who and why would I want anyone else to know who I paid?  The getting started checklist - the green clashes a bit with the blue/gray theme you have going on.  Maybe use a dark blue color for that?  The profile picture is yet another security concern.  On the one hand, it is good to see a photo of who you're dealing with - in this case, friends, but on the other hand, the security concerns outweigh the uniqueness.

I think having a checklist of who you owe money to would be important rather than a \"PAY\" button in which you have to enter a name into. It's very necessary to have a list of who owes you what and who you owe. I also think it'd be nice to have a button in which you can add notes to people. For instance, you can write down who they are if they are just an acquaintance, or you're looking to charge them for something in the future you've already done for them.
