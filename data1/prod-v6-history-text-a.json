Or put on there that it will be announced during the previous open house, I would also make \"free dance lessons\" text larger- free entices a lot of people who may not otherwise attend. I would also list a few of the dances that you'll teach. Most people don't know there are 4 styles of ballroom (latin, rhythm, standard and smooth) but rather that there are many different kinds of dances. I would pick 2 in the \"rhythm\" category (i.e. cha cha and rumba, or any of the others) and 2 in the \"smooth\" category-mention them explicitly so people have some idea of what they will be learning.\n\nIt might also be a good idea if you could come up with a fun tag line to put on the top of the flyer.
