"I actually find it really hard to read all the dates written on the woman. It is especially hard to read the first course right under ""Open Study"". Perhaps the woman could be made smaller, not filling the whole page with the writing next to it so you could actually read all the dates. Or else make the font bigger or bold. It is much easier to read where her shirt is darker blue. Also I would like to see a cost listed, or a website. I like the poster but I would need more information.""I don't know what it is advertising?  Is it a class, books or study materials.  Why are they using rosie the riveter, it doesn't seem to go with the message.  I'm not sure what the message is.""I like the picture but I feel a few things can be improved.  The ""Snack Provided"" needs a little more play.  Maybe a different color or a different font or something to make it stand out.  I feel like that is an important part of this poster.  Along the same lines, the information about the location, date, and times for the sessions are a bit hard to read and not well organized.  I would like to see them more readable and better lined up.  A larger font for the study sessions would be nice also.  Other than that, I like the poster and its a fun idea.""It's an excellent poster! Excellent choice of picture and font. My only constructive feedback would be to make sure that the places/times stand out a little more. Currently it's a little hard to read them (perhaps make the font bigger or bold, or give the font a different border color to make sure it's always visible.)""I like the design for the most part. The top is awesome and I like the lady, but its really hard to read the words on her shirt. Maybe bold the letters and make the small ones bigger. You could also maybe make the shirt color a little, or a combination of both."I think that a picture of the snacks can be added to the poster.  Also the rooms and times for the studies need to be in bolder writing.  They are hard too see given the boldness of the rest of the poster.  I would probably place this information on a background rather than the main graphic."The white lettering on the blue shirt needs to be changed. The font should be either thicker, or larger and that will make it easier to read."the design is very appealing i would however provide information on what the committee is about or what the meeting is for. is this an anti protest rally or study session? the picture doesn't really give information also if there is a phone number or email questions could be directed to you may want to list that"The white writing on her blue shirt is unattractive and hard to read. Move the writing to the yellow background, change it to a dark color and make the image smaller. It's the text that's important, not the image (which is over-used anyway).""Rosie the Riveter is a very famous poster.  Using her sends a message that your product matches the icon which she represents.  Looking at the rest of the text, I do not feel it is a good match.  Also, you need to get rid of the ""War Production Co-ordinating Committee"" and the other text which is part of the original design.  Finally, I hope that your target audience understands the ""jargon"" that is on the poster... e.g. ""MSE 401"" and MSE 201"" -- are those course numbers?  I would suggest you have a slogan up top like ""Rosie says it's time to 'Get to work on MSE!""   Overall, your design needs LOTS of work.""I like the design.  I think it is creative and edgy.  It looks like it would be advertising ballroom dancing which is what the descriptions says.  So, I would say the poster is right on.  If anything, maybe add more color.""I think the design is alright but would work much better if the background was purple and the figures and word ""dance"" were black.  The poster is easy to read and clearly states the dates, times, and locations.  I would print the poster.""I like the color scheme, but I think the advertisement would be more effective if it featured a real dancing couple instead of a clip art image. Real photos grab my attention more.""I think you should state what kind of dancing will be in this event. And perhaps what to wear. I would also change the design of the purple character, it looks a bit off against the black backround. I would probably put a real live dancing even photo on the backround of this poster and change the font of the words on this poster.""I think the purple really pops and makes you look at the poster. I found myself looking for a price. Maybe the cost, if there is one could be listed in small print on the bottom left corner. I liked the font but wondered if there is a font that ""flows"" kind of like dance? This font is bold, which stands out well, but I wondered if there would be a bold font that represented dance more. I like the poster though!""The poster isn't bad but I do have a couple suggestions.

I'd use a different color for the couple.  Purple and black may be a functional contrast, it's not really a great one especially with the purple being as dark as it is.

Put the ""Join us"" text block to the bottom of the poster.  There's a bunch of empty space around there and you could move the text block down or increase the font or expand the spaces in between.""I love the color scheme and the image used (the sharp purple cut-out looks very good and is eye-catching.) I would suggest finding a better font or re-arranging the information on the left in a more visually-appealing way, it's currently underwhelming. Perhaps take out ""TIME/PLACE"" and instead just list the dates/location and space it out a little bit better (left-justified, maybe). Also the tag-line should be reformatted so it's not in one block on the left. Try to make better use of the space!""1 at first glance it looks like the man has a big butt
2 the section that reads "" join us..."" should be listed as bullets and not a run on sentence
3 i would list the address where the event is being held""The text does not seem to be well aligned, therefore make them well aligned. Also the picture of the dancers seems too abstract. It might be go to create a silhouette of real dancers or even use a picture of real dancers."The two people dancing are not filled in all the way. There are white patches by the edges that could be easily fixed and it would look much nicer.
