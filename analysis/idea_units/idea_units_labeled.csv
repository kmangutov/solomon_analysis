665,The design is very p lain but eye-catching.,0
665," However, I do not really like the use of space and feel that the picture could be framed in a border.",2
665," Underneath the ""Join us..."" task, there is a very poor use of blank space; you could maybe use a different, bigger font, add more logos or anything.",2
665," Above the name of ""Illini Dancesport"" is a lot of blank space, as well I feel",0
666,The design is well done in my opinion.,0
666,I like the earthy tones of colors used for the site for Parkland College. Its very welcoming and easy to navigate from the looks of it.,0
666,I feel the design is going to make it easy on the consumers eyes and make it an easy experience to use.,0
667,too dark color,0
674,"I like the design but would make a few changes primarily to the fonts.  I would move the ""Join us ...."" portion down on the page a little bit and make the font about 20 percent bigger.",4
674," Also, I would consider making the date and time a different color. It does not catch my eye as it stands now and I feel like I really have to search for it. ",2
675,Very good design..,0
675,Left side bottom blank only.,4
675,No any other changes..,0
675,"
I like this work.. ",0
676,The top portion that is in  blue in color can be made broader.,2
678,I like the logo colors and design,0
678,this area looks a little dull compared to the other blocks and banners,7
678,nice graphic but this takes up quite a lot of space and doesn't communicate much,0
678,this area could use more promotion since people will go here looking for specifics,4
678,I assume this is promoting on campus events but probably needs a banner or heading,2
679,"the idea of this application is unique, it seems like a social networking site. ",3
679,how the bank details of person is secure? is there is enough privacy policies to protect the data from public?,5
679," the page design is simple, understandable and easy to follow. it is visually appealing.",0
681,"I hope this link will lead to a video introducing the community, what visitors can expect, local attractions and culture. A video would make future students feel welcome.",2
683,I like the layout.,0
683,I think the color scheme works well.,0
683,"Personally, I wouldn't change anything on it.  I would put it out there knowing if anything minor tweaks can be made as needed.  It looks to me like it is ready to be released.//Thanks",2
684,The outline of the image is a little lazy.,0
684,The wording across comes off oddly.,0
684,Would choose different colors that stand out better.,4
686,The logo must  come at top before title and it must be large.,4
686,The sentence written at the bottom should be brightened.,4
686,"
DANCE should be of different colour. ",4
686,There should be a name and contact details of a person to contact.,4
686,Optional: A slogan can be added.,2
687,"I would like a space between dance and sport. When it's together like that, it's hard to read.",4
687," Also, the color for the text of Open House 2015 and the other texts that match that color would look better if the text color was white. It will be bright and stand out more.",4
687," Last, in the section that says Join us for an evening of...after that, I would put a :, then a dash, etc. Below is an example of how I would do it.

Join us for an evening of:

688,"I would make the font here larger, I cant read it at all.",4
688,Make this logo just a  tad larger.,0
688,"I think the font here could be different, at least for this one word, like more interesting, something with movement.",2
688,"Determine this location, that seems vital.",4
688,I would just change up the font a bit. Its all the same and its a bit boring.,4
688,I like everything else.,0
690,A panel on the right side of the page which will enable the user to have a better control over the financial data.,4
690,At the same time there is not data showing the history or rating of the friend.,0
692,"The ""information for"" section is too big, maybe make it a little smaller. ",0=4

692,"Make the background look more modern, it looks more like a blog than it does a website as is right now.",
696,Alittle more information would be nice. Is this to get students for a dance class? How long does it last? what is the attire? are there refreshments?,5
699,Only name of the payee and received is specified but here the user photo and other identification mark can be included in order to improve the transaction effectively and safely,0=4

708,This text should really stand out. Looks like it's left in the background,0=4

717,"nice description, but maybe make it bold or in another color so it stands out, this is what it's all about, after all.",0=2
717,how will you get this information out once you have it? Maybe wait to put up fliers until you know this.,5=2
718,I would prefer that these buttons be rectangular.,4
718,The avatars of users who haven't yet added a photograph should instead be a procedurally generated image of their initials.,4
718,Reconsider the design of this logo.,4
719,change back ground color some make it more noticeable/ more of a contrast,4
719,I like this very easy,0
719,Add FAQ,4
719,have a button to add new groups,4

720,"The design and layout is not much attracting,can be given a good color background.",0=2

721,can you search by first and last name?,5
721,I like this feature,0
721,This is a good feature,0
721,I would add an FAQ section here,4
723,I like the background being black and it offsets the fonts well.,0
723," White might be a better choice for most of the lettering, rather than yellow, and with a change to the to the size of the fonts to make them larger.",4
723," I think you may need a little more detail on the dress requirements, and what is included for the open house (meet so and so, have refreshments, etc. to entice people to show up! ",4
725,These status/checklist bars are helpful for new users. I appreciate seeing these on apps I'm new to.,0
725,"Customizing profile with a photo is a nice option.

725,An organized way to keep tabs on friends who have the app.,0
725,"Seems like a very easy one-click system to get going with exchanging money. Nice.

725,I always appreciate not having to search all over a page for the Settings tab. This is a perfect place for it.,0
725,This timeline is attractive and easy to understand.,0
725,I appreciate being able to easily see the current balance without having to go to a specific payments page.,0
730,"I like see progress in % and a bar that helps me visualize

 ",0
730,"With money issues I don't want me photo going out to everyone. 
",0
732,I like to venmo queen,0
735,This graphic is very stylish and visually pleasing. It was the first design element that grabbed my attention.,0
735,"What styles of dance will the lessons be based on? I would like to know so I can invite friends who might be interested in learning with me.
",5
735,It's really difficult to read the text in this logo. Make it bigger so that it fills the whole upper left corner.,0=4
735,Move this text over and above the other headline text to make more space for the logo image.,4
735,"Is this for students only, or is the general public invited too?",5
735,I love the purple against the black and how it matches the image below. It really stands out from a distance.,0
745,The design is good,0
745,", but the graphic could be cleaned up a bit. It is a little choppy and hte corners aren't smooth. ",4
746,The ad is very attractive,0
746,", I love the purple over the black. It is a very sleek and stylish but still simple and easy to understand.  Not too much information or clutter but enough to draw interest.",0
747,The menu in the top part should be moved little down atleast the height of the site name.,4
747,There should be a big banner on the top.,4
747,"
The image should be of full width.",4
747,There is also a left blank area on the left side which should be filled off.,4
747,Make the text of the menu little bigger.,4
749,The design is average i feel.,0
749,I think the color scheme could have make better.,2
749,The font can also be changed to make a good feel.,2
750,I feel that this entire header and logo needs to be moved slightly higher on the page.  It feels a little out of balance.,0=4
750,I like the figures and their overall color.,0
750,"However, the color is not perfectly uniform and the edges show a lot of aliasing.  I feel this section should be refined and anti-aliased better.  GIMP has a great anti-aliasing feature.  ",0=2
750,I am not too sure about the flat black background.  Perhaps you should experiment with a very deep purple (almost black) which would give the illusion of depth.,2
750,"Also, this background uses a lot of ink and will be more difficult to print without smearing.  ",0
750,Grey is a very dull and uninteresting color.  How about using the same purple as the figures?,0=2
750,"Also, this paragraph feels like it is in the wrong spot and needs to be moved down and to the right.  ",0=4
750,"The large yellow fonts do not match the color of the small yellow fonts ""Room 314 A,"" etc.  I prefer the color of the small fonts, but the two yellows really should be matched.  ",0=4
750,The two lines of white text give a nice feeling of contrast and depth next to the two lines of yellow text.  It is almost 3 dimensional.,0
753,i believe you should list the dances,4
754,I give the design an overall 7 out of 10.,0
754,The purple is eye-catching.,0
754,The flow is pleasing on the eye.,0
754,The information is easy to find once I decide I want to attend.,0
754,The graphic conveys dance appropriately.,0
754,"The logo is not tacky or in-your-face, but appropriately placed. ",0
754,"

To improve the design, I would provide contact information.",4
754," I would also replace ""Time/Place"" with something less cumbersome. Perhaps, ""Location.""  ",4
754,I would also left justify the location details so as not to detract from the graphic of the people dancing.,3=4
755,I think its odd that you can follow the financial transactions of your friends. I don't really like that and would not want my friends to just be able to track all the money I'm spending.,0
755,Thats neat and all but if you can only charge or pay someone if they are signed up it doesn't make sense to use really.,0
755,"A little plain, lots of white space being used. ",0
755,Room for extra information maybe.,2
755,What is the percentage bar for thatsays getting started? Whats the point of that?,5
757,"The words Illini Dancesport Dance Open House 2015 needs to be centered better on the page. It feels odd, particularly with that large empty space under the word Dancesport. ",0=4
757,"The colors are good, ",0
757,but the text needs a better layout.,4
757,I'd consider maybe moving the logo under Illini to a different part of the image and then centering the main title.,4
757,I'd also add some bolding to words like Time/Place and anything else that needs to stand out so make it easier to read.,4
760,The green is awful.,0
760,The image in the center is too big.,0
760,It almost looks like a website from 2000. Reminds me of SPAM.,0
762,The two buttons that say 'pay' and 'charge' are not catchy because of its color.,0
762,Both of these can be either the same color or different.,0
762,I think these buttons being the most important part of the page can be highlighted either with catching colors or attractive button designs.,4
763,It looks easy to use.,0
763," I was a little confused by the term ""charge"", you mean you are asking those people for money? Is there another word or phrase that could be used?",5
763,"
It seems like a good tool for collecting money.",0
763," Could you include groups and budgets, such as for a party or group trip?",2
766,I feel there should be home button to come back to main home page.,4
766,I'm not sure whether the PARKLAND COLLEGE image have the link to comeback to main page.,0
766,Design looks simple and easy to navigate.,0
768,The Poster design is short and simple.,0
768,This poster shows every information about the dance show but it is slightly less attractive.,0
768,Can improve the attractiveness of the poster by giving some colorful outline borders.,4
769,I suggest pink background for  this program. It will attract lot of people.,4
771,They paid them in Poutine? The language kind of doesnt make sense,0=5
771,Why should anyone know who paid what? Where is the privacy?,0
771,"What is this? User driven or venmo driven? If it is a site gimmick to get users to do more stuff on the site, remove it. Its annoying",5
771,I like the amount listed here,0
772,Some of the edges still have white on the image.,0
772,This blank space seems awkward.,0
774,Way too busy and too much information for homepage.,0
774,"Also, I don't see this appealing to community college students... no marketing appeal to that demographic.",0
774,I would change the colors (this looks like hospital green); maybe black and white with splashes of color;,4
774,I would go with a more graphic book type of look.,2
774,"  I would totally eliminate the left hand bottom quarter (Go ahead...) square, just keep the ""go ahead, visit us!"" link.",4
774," I would retain ""in the news"" link but eliminate the links under it... same for campus events. ",4
774,I like the photo but maybe incorporate her picture into a photo of 3 or 4 students to represent community and diversity.,0=4
774," In the ""information"" square I would move""coming to Parkland"" to be first, and ""Information"" second. ",4
774,All in all I would cut down the amount of verbal information on this first page by at least 50%.,4

789,Scott Scholz,9
789,"Here you go Scott, hopefully the legalized extortionists in Boise won't get this! ",9
791,The color green is not good.,0
791,The image is very large. Instead it can be utilized for some more information to be given.,0=4
794,I feel like this area is too crammed and messy.,0
794,you should make this area bigger or take away some of the text here.,4
794,"I like this picture but you should make the green area that says ""Go Ahead"" smaller and show more of the picture of the girl. ",4
794,I think the google search bar should be moved to the top of the page.,4
795,Too much green the lettering is too big in this section,0
795,Pictures need to show more ethnic diversity to attract those students.,2
795,I like the fact that this is placed here first on the page.  That is what most people are interested in.,0
796,The design has no security.  Before transferring money privacy must be provided and money transfer must be in secure mode. Here it is very critical. Please take it in to consideration.,9
798,I would suggest aligning this time to the left with the other time.,0
799,"The white on green is a good contradiction in colors, ",0
799,"but the print is so small it's hard to read. Maybe the letter should be enlarged, or in bold to emphasize.",0=2
799," Other than that, the design is minimalist is nature, and it works great. It's easy to see the flow of the page, and is not intrusive.",0
800,The overall design is very good and to attractive.,0
800,Its background design and font is so good .,0
800,Overall no need for the improvement,0
802,Friends' comments area has occupied more room of the page.,0
802,It can be fixed size but make scroll-able content.,4
802,There would be shown footer giving some more other information.,4
804,I feel the Pay & Charge tabs should be bigger in size. That just helps a new person understand the important tabs they need to use.,3=4
804,You could also display a list of friends on the page whom they can transfer readily. Something where they can just tick the name & transfer the money cause people generally look at the ease of using the page as well.,4
807,"Next to the names for those that transferred money should be the amount that was transferred. For example, ""Tristan paid Stan Brand"" should be ""Tristan paid Stan Brand $XX.XX. ",4
807,"There should also be an icon near the friend's name that denote how much money you transferred to him/her previously, and when that transfer happened.",4
810,There is the improvement in the image of the girl is good,4
810,"but the go ahead grow,  tab bar is not nice.  ",0
810,You have to change this by wohole image shown and the watermark tobe used for text.,4
813,Pending and approved Transaction label.,9
813,A chat window to see our freinds list.,4
813,"A green icon next to the logged in user , to see if he is online right now.

815,Use a different colored font that will capture more attention and be noticeable.,4
815,Move this over to be aligned with the statement below it.,4
815,"List the ticket price or cost to participate, or state ""Free admission"" if there is no cost.",4
822,It looks to me like a good design.,0
822,It looks user friendly.,0
822,I think it would be a good app to have!,0
826,Just link contact from social sites,4
826,and improving in user interface,0
826,making it more appealing by adding animation,0
836,I LIKE THE SIMPLISITY,0
836,BUT THECOLORS SEEM DRAB TO ME,0
836,I AM NOT A FAN OF THE PURPLE CLIP ART,0
839,i t will be good if you add contact that will import from social sites,4
839,and by improving user interface which will appeal more by bringing animation in the page,4
841,The bottom left of the page is too cluttered and disorganized.,0
841,The links are too small to read.,0
841,Make the links bigger.,4
841,Make the picture of the smiling student smaller.,4
842,"I think it would be more effective and efficient to list paid/charged status in different colors, to promote at-a-glance recognition.",4
843,"I'm not sure a ""like"" click is necessary for a pay site.  Perhaps I'm not getting this but it looks to be far more social media than a pay site. ",0
843,I think there are already many forms of social media out there and my first concern with the social atmosphere I see here would be security...are my details being protected.  Why would I want to know who paid who and why would I want anyone else to know who I paid?,0
843,The getting started checklist - the green clashes a bit with the blue/gray theme you have going on.  Maybe use a dark blue color for that?,2
843,The profile picture is yet another security concern.,9
843,"On the one hand, it is good to see a photo of who you're dealing with - in this case, friends, but on the other hand, the security concerns outweigh the uniqueness.  ",0
845,There should be pictures of college n the picture of  an infrastructure of college.,4
845,"seeing the different area of college student will get more idea about yhe college n its facilities like sports ground ,cantiness ,lab etc .",0
845,it should mention the names of top students n rewiews for better understanding of college .,4
845,the design in other ways is good,0
846,Move text downard more.,4
846,Odd negative space.,0
846,It is hard to interpert characters.,0
846,This is not necessary and the slash looks awkward.,0
847,Why is there a search bar for people when the intended use for this application is for friends to transfer funds to friends. Each person should be given a unique identifier to quickly add someone. This isn't facebook. I shouldn't be able to just look anyone up.,5
847,Users should not be allowed to operate accounts without an accurate profile picture.,9
847,What exactly am I charging someone for?,9
848,"These texts are very difficult to read, try changing the font.",4
848,"reduce the size of ""go ahead""",4
848,this text can be written little bigger,4
848,well arranged menu,0
856,Chatting dashboard can be changed to money conversion rates from one place to another or one country to another can be displayed,4
858,Maybe include Ballroom in the title,2
858,"Capitalize FREE

858,I would choose another color.  Maybe blue.,2
858,"Decide on a location

858,Leave this heading out.  It looks weird.,0=4
858,Line this up with the other time,4
859,Are you automatically pulling contacts from social media?,5
859,does a charge effectively just send a request to get paid?,9
861,I think it's kind of strange that everyone can see what everyone is paying each other in this app/site. Are some of the transactions private?,9
861,"This site is usable, but I'm not sure if there's a huge audience for people who want others to see their transactions.",0
861," I think having a checklist of who you owe money to would be important rather than a ""PAY"" button in which you have to enter a name into.",4
861,It's very necessary to have a list of who owes you what and who you owe.,4
861," I also think it'd be nice to have a button in which you can add notes to people. For instance, you can write down who they are if they are just an acquaintance, or you're looking to charge them for something in the future you've already done for them. ",4
861,Good and simple layout though.,0
866,Inefficient use of space.,0
866,Organization lacking.,0
866,Too many ads.,0
867,The design is a little boring. It does not draw my attention to the screen.,0
867,I think some of the buttons should be in a color other than blue or white like the bar at the top of the screen.,4
867,The page itself should be in a color other than white. It seems to be a bit distracting and unable to follow.,4
868,I think you should change the colors they look a little dual to me you should pick colors that brighten the picture,4
872,I feel like the site jumps out at you.,0
872,ALl the information is nicely stacked on the left.,0
872,A mnice motto in the middle.,9
872,Some other less than important things on the bottom right if you're new and don't care about.,4
872,And some banner ads to visit.,9
