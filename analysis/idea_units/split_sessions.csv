Or at least not have the ""Invite some friends item.""  #But otherwise, looks very interesting and intuitive."1280,This area should be aligned to the left instead of out of sync.  1280,There is too much open space here1280,It would have been more classy to use a simple black and white image and make the image smoother.  It's too jagged.1280,"There is a lot of empty space here, #but the black is elegant"1280,Keep text to one color1280,White text would be better rather than a variety of colors1280,Your logo should be larger in order to draw the eye in and create interest in the organization.

Possibly even a lighter shade of purple to compliment the art & ""DANCE""? "1310,This is decent. # The colors do pop and it's  simple. 1311,I'm not sure why their needs to be a social media money exchanger?  Why do we need to see friends??1311,I'm not understanding this either. Am I actually supposed to comment on people's money exchanges? I'm not sure that would work or catch on.1311,I see what you're going for but the facebook of money exchanges just doesn't seem like it would be a hit. I wouldn't use it.1311,"Find friends should show how you can actually find friends, email? name?"1311,"I'd move the text over slightly,# it looks like there is a bit too much space next to the logo even though it's probably the same as the right."1314,"I like the top half. It's easy to read and eye-pleasing.# The follow text on the right side, bottom half could be better placed. #The text choice makes it look amatuer-ish. #I would pick and stick with one font for the information. The silhouettes is a bit messy, you can see where the poor clipping is, the edges that show some white.

It could be lighter, possibly with more color. #The Pay and Charge buttons would stand out more if they had bright colors."1320,"I would personally stick to one solid color instead of  the links having a gradient background and the overall background being a gradient.# A good idea would be to take the gradient background off of the links and choosing a solid color that matches the entire cells gradient, that would show up on link hover.# Otherwise the rest of the design looks nice. "1325,"Too many different colors of green; choose a more concise palette and then stick with it. #The menu items on the top left probably shouldn't not be gradiented because they don't clearly indicate their functionality.# A better choice would be to have them all be consistent color when not moused-over and then turn a different shade when an individual one IS moused-over. #Finally, what's up with the background being a gradient itself? There are more than enough gradients on the page already, it feels reallllly overboard."1328,"I don't think I would have picked the color scheme of black and purple. It should be more vibrant, in my opinion."1328,This wall of text is kind of just on the background and does not really stand out to be read easily.1329,"If the poster is meant to be for students interested in ballroom dancing then that should be mentioned before mentioning ""dance performances"". People that are interested are probably more interested in the lessons and might be thrown off if they don't read the whole sign such as on the way to class.# The font color for the ""join us"" part seems dark and should be brought to the forefront of the poster with a brighter color."1334,I really like the overall color scheme# but I see there are some slight issues with the icon in the right hand corner. If you look close you can see white splotches where if looks like the black background was suppose to fill in and it wasn't done very sharp or blended together.1338,"There are some white specks surrounding the silhouette of the man and woman dancing. Doesn't make it look to professional. Fill in the white specks around the hand, head, neck, and collar of the man. #Also, not quite sure what the white double vertical line is to the right of the logo. It seems out of place and holds no relevance. "1340,Change the colors1341,Even though it's done by a lot of websites theres is a reason most websites put the profile info and everything that goes with it on the left side it makes it easier to seperate it from the actual page in your mind when reading left to right.# Other than that. It has a nice color scheme and an easy to understand interface.1342,Change the colors1345,"I think it needs an obvious way of making a transaction private, for one.# It seems a little unpolished overall, but very clean, simple, and easily understandable."1348,Make sure there is some way to make the payment transfers hidden so that you don't automatically show everyone who you are giving money to.1351,Does this verify its users? I see that having a picture isnt required and that makes me believe it doesn't verify.1362,"The outline of the dancers on the bottom left is a bit strange looking to me. #In order to use that art on the design, I would make it a bit smaller and move it more towards the top of the page, near the top text. I would then remove the excess black space form the bottom of the design.# Perhaps more vibrant, yet very similar, colors would also help make the design more pleasing to the eye.# Other than that, I think that the design serves it's purpose well.

Maybe something should be done to distinguish it. #It may look better without the borders around the timeline.
