session,corpus
665,"The design is very p lain but eye-catching. However, I do not really like the use of space and feel that the picture could be framed in a border. Underneath the ""Join us..."" task, there is a very poor use of blank space; you could maybe use a different, bigger font, add more logos or anything. Above the name of ""Illini Dancesport"" is a lot of blank space, as well I feel"
666,The design is well done in my opinion. I like the earthy tones of colors used for the site for Parkland College. Its very welcoming and easy to navigate from the looks of it. I feel the design is going to make it easy on the consumers eyes and make it an easy experience to use. 
667,too dark color
674,"I like the design but would make a few changes primarily to the fonts.  I would move the ""Join us ...."" portion down on the page a little bit and make the font about 20 percent bigger. Also, I would consider making the date and time a different color. It does not catch my eye as it stands now and I feel like I really have to search for it. "
675,"Very good design.. Left side bottom blank only.  No any other changes.. 
I like this work.. "
676,The top portion that is in  blue in color can be made broader.
678,I like the logo colors and design
678,this area looks a little dull compared to the other blocks and banners
678,nice graphic but this takes up quite a lot of space and doesn't communicate much
678,this area could use more promotion since people will go here looking for specifics
678,I assume this is promoting on campus events but probably needs a banner or heading
679,"the idea of this application is unique, it seems like a social networking site. how the bank details of person is secure? is there is enough privacy policies to protect the data from public? the page design is simple, understandable and easy to follow. it is visually appealing."
681,"I hope this link will lead to a video introducing the community, what visitors can expect, local attractions and culture. A video would make future students feel welcome."
683,"I like the layout.  I think the color scheme works well.  Personally, I wouldn't change anything on it.  I would put it out there knowing if anything minor tweaks can be made as needed.  It looks to me like it is ready to be released.//Thanks"
684,The outline of the image is a little lazy. 
684,The wording across comes off oddly. 
684,Would choose different colors that stand out better.
686,"The logo must  come at top before title and it must be large. The sentence written at the bottom should be brightened.
DANCE should be of different colour. There should be a name and contact details of a person to contact. Optional: A slogan can be added."
687,"I would like a space between dance and sport. When it's together like that, it's hard to read. Also, the color for the text of Open House 2015 and the other texts that match that color would look better if the text color was white. It will be bright and stand out more. Last, in the section that says Join us for an evening of...after that, I would put a :, then a dash, etc. Below is an example of how I would do it.

Join us for an evening of:
-dance performances
-FREE dance lessons
Showcasing 4 styles of ballroom dance!"
688,"I would make the font here larger, I cant read it at all."
688,Make this logo just a  tad larger.
688,"I think the font here could be different, at least for this one word, like more interesting, something with movement."
688,"Determine this location, that seems vital."
688,I would just change up the font a bit. Its all the same and its a bit boring. I like everything else.
690,A panel on the right side of the page which will enable the user to have a better control over the financial data. At the same time there is not data showing the history or rating of the friend.
692,"The ""information for"" section is too big, maybe make it a little smaller. Also, the news and campus events section has font too small. Make it a little bigger and it would be great. Another thing might be to get rid of a little of the green, seems like there is too much there. Maybe move the ads to the top of the page so they don't interfere with the information sections. Make the Contact us section more readily available as it can not be seen on the page as well as other sections. The font in the top where you choose a section seems a bit too basic, add a new style to it and make it a little more stylish. Make the background look more modern, it looks more like a blog than it does a website as is right now."
696,Alittle more information would be nice. Is this to get students for a dance class? How long does it last? what is the attire? are there refreshments?
699,Only name of the payee and received is specified but here the user photo and other identification mark can be included in order to improve the transaction effectively and safely
706,"nice font
"
706,easy use options
706,"adding a photo is great so people can make sure to send money to the right friend
"
706,"nice to see what still needs to be done to use venmo
"
708,"I think this graphic could stand out more, perhaps another color as well. "
708,This text should really stand out. Looks like it's left in the background
708,background could be a lot better. dark black will use a lot of ink! 
717,"this is unclear and hard to read, I would make it larger so people can tell what it is."
717,"kind of a weird empty gap, might be able to rearrange things a little better so it doesn't look so scattered and awkward."
717,"nice, bold text, easy to read."
717,"this text is all a bit pushed together, spread it out and make the text size a bit larger."
717,"nice, simple graphic that adds to the appeal of the flier. "
717,"spread this out a bit more, it's a little crowded."
717,"nice description, but maybe make it bold or in another color so it stands out, this is what it's all about, after all."
717,how will you get this information out once you have it? Maybe wait to put up fliers until you know this.
718,I would prefer that these buttons be rectangular.
718,The avatars of users who haven't yet added a photograph should instead be a procedurally generated image of their initials.
718,Reconsider the design of this logo.
719,change back ground color some make it more noticeable/ more of a contrast  
719,I like this very easy 
719,Add FAQ 
719,have a button to add new groups 
719,Is this the total in the account? Not 100% clear
720,"The design and layout is not much attracting,can be given a good color background.The money transfers are public so it may hamper the privacy of the sender and receiver,so the aspect of privacy should be demonstrated or used."
721,what does this blank do? Is this where you put a dollar amount?
721,can you search by first and last name?
721,I like this feature
721,This is a good feature
721,I would add an FAQ section here
723,"I like the background being black and it offsets the fonts well. White might be a better choice for most of the lettering, rather than yellow, and with a change to the to the size of the fonts to make them larger. I think you may need a little more detail on the dress requirements, and what is included for the open house (meet so and so, have refreshments, etc. to entice people to show up! "
725,These status/checklist bars are helpful for new users. I appreciate seeing these on apps I'm new to.  
725,"Customizing profile with a photo is a nice option.
"
725,An organized way to keep tabs on friends who have the app. 
725,"Seems like a very easy one-click system to get going with exchanging money. Nice.
"
725,I always appreciate not having to search all over a page for the Settings tab. This is a perfect place for it. 
725,This timeline is attractive and easy to understand. 
725,I appreciate being able to easily see the current balance without having to go to a specific payments page. 
730,"I like see progress in % and a bar that helps me visualize

 "
730,"With money issues I don't want me photo going out to everyone. 
"
732,I like to venmo queen
735,This graphic is very stylish and visually pleasing. It was the first design element that grabbed my attention.
735,"What styles of dance will the lessons be based on? I would like to know so I can invite friends who might be interested in learning with me.
"
735,It's really difficult to read the text in this logo. Make it bigger so that it fills the whole upper left corner.
735,Move this text over and above the other headline text to make more space for the logo image.
735,"Is this for students only, or is the general public invited too?"
735,I love the purple against the black and how it matches the image below. It really stands out from a distance.
745,"The design is good, but the graphic could be cleaned up a bit. It is a little choppy and hte corners aren't smooth. "
746,"The ad is very attractive, I love the purple over the black. It is a very sleek and stylish but still simple and easy to understand.  Not too much information or clutter but enough to draw interest."
747,"The menu in the top part should be moved little down atleast the height of the site name.There should be a big banner on the top.
The image should be of full width.There is also a left blank area on the left side which should be filled off.Make the text of the menu little bigger."
749,The design is average i feel. I think the color scheme could have make better. The font can also be changed to make a good feel. 
750,I feel that this entire header and logo needs to be moved slightly higher on the page.  It feels a little out of balance.  
750,"I like the figures and their overall color.  However, the color is not perfectly uniform and the edges show a lot of aliasing.  I feel this section should be refined and anti-aliased better.  GIMP has a great anti-aliasing feature.  "
750,"I am not too sure about the flat black background.  Perhaps you should experiment with a very deep purple (almost black) which would give the illusion of depth.  Also, this background uses a lot of ink and will be more difficult to print without smearing.  "
750,"Grey is a very dull and uninteresting color.  How about using the same purple as the figures?  Also, this paragraph feels like it is in the wrong spot and needs to be moved down and to the right.  "
750,"The large yellow fonts do not match the color of the small yellow fonts ""Room 314 A,"" etc.  I prefer the color of the small fonts, but the two yellows really should be matched.  "
750,The two lines of white text give a nice feeling of contrast and depth next to the two lines of yellow text.  It is almost 3 dimensional.  
753,i believe you should list the dances
754,"I give the design an overall 7 out of 10. The purple is eye-catching. The flow is pleasing on the eye. The information is easy to find once I decide I want to attend. The graphic conveys dance appropriately. The logo is not tacky or in-your-face, but appropriately placed. 

To improve the design, I would provide contact information. I would also replace ""Time/Place"" with something less cumbersome. Perhaps, ""Location.""  I would also left justify the location details so as not to detract from the graphic of the people dancing. "
755,"I think its odd that you can follow the financial transactions of your friends. I don't really like that and would not want my friends to just be able to track all the money I'm spending. Thats neat and all but if you can only charge or pay someone if they are signed up it doesn't make sense to use really. A little plain, lots of white space being used. Room for extra information maybe. What is the percentage bar for thatsays getting started? Whats the point of that?"
757,"The words Illini Dancesport Dance Open House 2015 needs to be centered better on the page. It feels odd, particularly with that large empty space under the word Dancesport. The colors are good, but the text needs a better layout. I'd consider maybe moving the logo under Illini to a different part of the image and then centering the main title. I'd also add some bolding to words like Time/Place and anything else that needs to stand out so make it easier to read."
760,The green is awful. The image in the center is too big. It almost looks like a website from 2000. Reminds me of SPAM.
762,The two buttons that say 'pay' and 'charge' are not catchy because of its color. Both of these can be either the same color or different. I think these buttons being the most important part of the page can be highlighted either with catching colors or attractive button designs.
763,"It looks easy to use. I was a little confused by the term ""charge"", you mean you are asking those people for money? Is there another word or phrase that could be used?
It seems like a good tool for collecting money. Could you include groups and budgets, such as for a party or group trip?"
766,I feel there should be home button to come back to main home page.I'm not sure whether the PARKLAND COLLEGE image have the link to comeback to main page.Design looks simple and easy to navigate.
768,The Poster design is short and simple. This poster shows every information about the dance show but it is slightly less attractive. Can improve the attractiveness of the poster by giving some colorful outline borders.
769,I suggest pink background for  this program. It will attract lot of people.
771,They paid them in Poutine? The language kind of doesnt make sense
771,Why should anyone know who paid what? Where is the privacy?
771,"What is this? User driven or venmo driven? If it is a site gimmick to get users to do more stuff on the site, remove it. Its annoying"
771,I like the amount listed here
772,Some of the edges still have white on the image.
772,This blank space seems awkward.
774,"Way too busy and too much information for homepage. Also, I don't see this appealing to community college students... no marketing appeal to that demographic. I would change the colors (this looks like hospital green); maybe black and white with splashes of color; I would go with a more graphic book type of look.  I would totally eliminate the left hand bottom quarter (Go ahead...) square, just keep the ""go ahead, visit us!"" link. I would retain ""in the news"" link but eliminate the links under it... same for campus events. I like the photo but maybe incorporate her picture into a photo of 3 or 4 students to represent community and diversity. In the ""information"" square I would move""coming to Parkland"" to be first, and ""Information"" second. All in all I would cut down the amount of verbal information on this first page by at least 50%."

789,"Pam Davis 
"
789,Scott Scholz
789,"Here you go Scott, hopefully the legalized extortionists in Boise won't get this! "
791,The color green is not good. The image is very large. Instead it can be utilized for some more information to be given.
794,I feel like this area is too crammed and messy. you should make this area bigger or take away some of the text here.
794,"I like this picture but you should make the green area that says ""Go Ahead"" smaller and show more of the picture of the girl. "
794,I think the google search bar should be moved to the top of the page.
795,Too much green the lettering is too big in this section
795,Pictures need to show more ethnic diversity to attract those students.
795,I like the fact that this is placed here first on the page.  That is what most people are interested in.
796,The design has no security.  Before transferring money privacy must be provided and money transfer must be in secure mode. Here it is very critical. Please take it in to consideration.
798,I would suggest aligning this time to the left with the other time.
799,"The white on green is a good contradiction in colors, but the print is so small it's hard to read. Maybe the letter should be enlarged, or in bold to emphasize. Other than that, the design is minimalist is nature, and it works great. It's easy to see the flow of the page, and is not intrusive."
800,The overall design is very good and to attractive.Its background design and font is so good .Overall no need for the improvement
802,Friends' comments area has occupied more room of the page. It can be fixed size but make scroll-able content. There would be shown footer giving some more other information.
804,I feel the Pay & Charge tabs should be bigger in size. That just helps a new person understand the important tabs they need to use.You could also display a list of friends on the page whom they can transfer readily. Something where they can just tick the name & transfer the money cause people generally look at the ease of using the page as well. 
807,"Next to the names for those that transferred money should be the amount that was transferred. For example, ""Tristan paid Stan Brand"" should be ""Tristan paid Stan Brand $XX.XX. There should also be an icon near the friend's name that denote how much money you transferred to him/her previously, and when that transfer happened."
810,"There is the improvement in the image of the girl is good but the go ahead grow,  tab bar is not nice.  You have to change this by wohole image shown and the watermark tobe used for text. "
813,"Pending and approved Transaction label. A chat window to see our freinds list. A green icon next to the logged in user , to see if he is online right now. 
"
815,Use a different colored font that will capture more attention and be noticeable. 
815,Move this over to be aligned with the statement below it.
815,"List the ticket price or cost to participate, or state ""Free admission"" if there is no cost."
822,It looks to me like a good design.  It looks user friendly.  I think it would be a good app to have!
826,Just link contact from social sites and improving in user interface making it more appealing by adding animation 
836,I LIKE THE SIMPLISITY BUT THECOLORS SEEM DRAB TO ME I AM NOT A FAN OF THE PURPLE CLIP ART
839,i t will be good if you add contact that will import from social sites and by improving user interface which will appeal more by bringing animation in the page
841,The bottom left of the page is too cluttered and disorganized. The links are too small to read. Make the links bigger. Make the picture of the smiling student smaller.
842,"I think it would be more effective and efficient to list paid/charged status in different colors, to promote at-a-glance recognition."
843,"I'm not sure a ""like"" click is necessary for a pay site.  Perhaps I'm not getting this but it looks to be far more social media than a pay site.  I think there are already many forms of social media out there and my first concern with the social atmosphere I see here would be security...are my details being protected.  Why would I want to know who paid who and why would I want anyone else to know who I paid?  The getting started checklist - the green clashes a bit with the blue/gray theme you have going on.  Maybe use a dark blue color for that?  The profile picture is yet another security concern.  On the one hand, it is good to see a photo of who you're dealing with - in this case, friends, but on the other hand, the security concerns outweigh the uniqueness.  "
845,"There should be pictures of college n the picture of  an infrastructure of college.seeing the different area of college student will get more idea about yhe college n its facilities like sports ground ,cantiness ,lab etc .it should mention the names of top students n rewiews for better understanding of college .the design in other ways is good "
846,Move text downard more.
846,Odd negative space. It is hard to interpert characters.
846,This is not necessary and the slash looks awkward.
847,Why is there a search bar for people when the intended use for this application is for friends to transfer funds to friends. Each person should be given a unique identifier to quickly add someone. This isn't facebook. I shouldn't be able to just look anyone up. 
847,Users should not be allowed to operate accounts without an accurate profile picture.
847,What exactly am I charging someone for?
848,"These texts are very difficult to read, try changing the font."
848,"reduce the size of ""go ahead"""
848,this text can be written little bigger
848,well arranged menu
856,Chatting dashboard can be changed to money conversion rates from one place to another or one country to another can be displayed
858,Maybe include Ballroom in the title
858,"Capitalize FREE
"
858,I would choose another color.  Maybe blue.
858,"Decide on a location
"
858,Leave this heading out.  It looks weird.
858,Line this up with the other time
859,Are you automatically pulling contacts from social media?
859,does a charge effectively just send a request to get paid?
861,"I think it's kind of strange that everyone can see what everyone is paying each other in this app/site. Are some of the transactions private? This site is usable, but I'm not sure if there's a huge audience for people who want others to see their transactions. I think having a checklist of who you owe money to would be important rather than a ""PAY"" button in which you have to enter a name into. It's very necessary to have a list of who owes you what and who you owe. I also think it'd be nice to have a button in which you can add notes to people. For instance, you can write down who they are if they are just an acquaintance, or you're looking to charge them for something in the future you've already done for them. Good and simple layout though. "
866,Inefficient use of space. Organization lacking. Too many ads.
867,The design is a little boring. It does not draw my attention to the screen. I think some of the buttons should be in a color other than blue or white like the bar at the top of the screen. The page itself should be in a color other than white. It seems to be a bit distracting and unable to follow.
868,I think you should change the colors they look a little dual to me you should pick colors that brighten the picture
872,I feel like the site jumps out at you. ALl the information is nicely stacked on the left. A mnice motto in the middle. Some other less than important things on the bottom right if you're new and don't care about. And some banner ads to visit. A search bar to quickly find what you need and a quick links navigation bar. I think it looks fairly nice for that type of site
873,"Better placeholder profile pictures
"
873,FAQ
873,"Clean design that's easy to read.
"
873,Home button not really necessary. 
877,Could have used some lively colors that would spark once excitement. The black background and the other colors used is too dull.
878,"Increase font size, so that it can be easily readable.
Reduce the size of the picture and give more space to the information.
When a new news item comes, it  can be placed in the bottom ""as the latest news...."" caption so that it can be easily identified.
"
879,The GO is too big in my opinion
879,"Change the font to make it more exciting!
"
881,The design was exclusive and extraordinary.It is too difficult for anyone too handle.
882,"What is this used for? Do you search for your friends here, or input a dollar amount? 
"
882,"Is there any way to change this so people can't see what I bought? I'm not super comfortable with everyone knowing what my purchases are.
"
882,"Are these friends from linked social media accounts, or friends who are also using this site/app?
"
882,"Why is there ""Public"" group? This is an app/site designed to transfer money between friends; why would I ever want or need to connect to people I don't know? 
"
889,This design is pretty basic and has a great layout to it. I like this format and layout for this webpage because its easy to read and understand. There is not a lot of bulk categories that would have you confused about were to navigate to. That's what makes this design good.
890,"It appears very straight forward, lots of green on the page which suggests green is the color for the college. Has obvious links to figure out where you need to go once you access this page. It is easy to read and easy to know where to go from there.  "
893,"very small, difficult to read
"
893,Not clear what this area is for.
893,Area should be bigger 
898,"I really like the design, but I think you could spread it out with more colors, instead of throwing green everywhere on the page, and maybe don't use the logo and what not so many times over the page, it makes it look busy."
899,"Edges look jagged, as if cut out with scissors"
899,Space from the right is not the same as space from the left
899,Too much empty space
900,"Looks decent, but I'll put ""In the news"" and ""Campus events"" beneath informations on the left."
906,"Time and place options could be left-justified in order to better frame the graphic on the right
"
906,artifacts could easily be cleaned up in illustrator: vectorize graphic for a cleaner look
906,"change to times and places, add bullet points to show these are different sessions"
907,"The left menu bar is too wide. No need for it to fit the entire logo width. The bottom graphics on the left look like ads, so I didn't even want to look at them. You have a header with links, a sidebar with links, and a quick links bar, not to mention all the lengths in the body. Having actual content on the homepage would be great."
910,"Design not good, should be improve design for this site."
913,"The heading should include the address, or at least the state.
"
913,"Earning full college credit in 8 weeks is an appealing offer, this section should be made a little bigger."
913,This portion should have a slideshow running instead of one stationary photo.
915,"So others can see what money you've transferred to which person?  I don't like that.
"
915,What are they charging them for?  I'm very confused as to the purpose of this site.
915,How safe is this?  And how much does it cost?
915,Really need more info on the page.  What is the purpose?  Why is everyone else able to see what you're doing?  Why are people paying people? How do you do it?
917,"I like the colors, but would make the silhouettes black  and choose a different background color to avoid the ""floating hand effect."" Otherwise, I'd continue to use the purple, but would fill in the male dancer's collar, tie, and hand, so that it's a true silhouette. "
918,"I like the design, though there are a few things I would recommend changing. One, it's a lot of green. The words at the bottom right could also be a bit bigger and better designed. "
920,"I agree, mention that it is ballroom dance in the title
"
920,I can't read the font either. It should be larger
920,I can't tell what this says as the orange circles cover it
920,May look nicer lined up but it doesn't bother me
920,I agree but I didn't really notice it until I clocked on the comment
920,I didn't have trouble with this
920,I like the black background it looks classy
920,"yeah, FREE would standout out (if capitalized)"
920,"yeah, I think it should wait until the location is established to print these"
920,I might choose white for this
921,"I think it would be better if the woman's shadow was a different color. The man and woman sort of collide and make them somewhat indistinguishable. The font is okay, but I might play with different font styles to see if I could find something classier looking. Other than that, it's a good poster. I like it. Eye catching."
924,Need more explanation of what this means
924,The title of app should stand out more
924,"Maybe make the ""Pay"" and ""Charge"" buttons a different color"
924,Add a little more depth and personality by changing the background color to something more engaging than white
924,"Not sure why current user, Milford Meade, should be able to see different friends are paying other friends. If this is an Admin view, or this person is in charge of the gathering, then disreard"
928,"Most of it is rather good,a lthough there's something about the word ""DANCE"" and the picture of the couple dancing itself that seems a little off. For some reason it looks sloppy, and the choice of the shade of purple isn't all that appealing. The font for DANCE also isn't great, though I do agree it should be bolded and thick lettering. The purple would probably be best if it were changed to another color, perhaps somewhere between robin egg blue or teal? If you want to keep a cooler shade that is. A warm shade could also be good, and it'd capture your eye immediately against the dark black background. If you WERE to change the color to something warm, I'd recommend a yellow or an orange, which would also fit well because the date of the event is nearing the end of summer/beginning of fall and orange and yellow are good fall and summer colors. "
930,"I don't think a person needs to know all the transactions between friends. The app should show only what a person pays or charges, that is, only their personal transactions. 
Also, the app needs more colors other than blue and white. It looks a little bland and uninteresting."
931,I would align the time and dates to the left instead of the right.  Also changing the image of the dancers. Outline them or add more colors
933,I think the purple really draws the attention. It is easy to know this is for dancing and the wording flows very nicely.
935,"these people are a weird blob, perhaps fused together after a nuclear blast, maybe do something to make them seperate"
935,"lose it, don;t know why its here, looks like a mistake"
937,"This looks similar to Facebook which is not good.
"
937,Peoples pictures should show /they should be required to have one.
938,"I like the ""go Ahead"" theme carried through the page.  The color green does go along with ""Go"", but there is too much of it.  Though it looks like it's a part of your branding, as it's on on the logo.
""In the News"" and ""Campus Events"" seem bland compared to rest of page.  Need to spice it up, IMHO.
The ""As You Like It"" ad seems out of place."
939,"I can't tell what this says.
"
940,Use a more contrasting color than gray on a black background. This looks washed out.
940,This has little bits of white pixelation and looks like a poor quality JPEG. I would change this to a vector or something.
940,Make the logo bigger.
940,"Make this larger and stand out more, maybe mimic the purple color that's being used in the graphic."
940,"Make this larger, make it stand out more."
943,The layout is easy to understand and the website seems to be easy to navigate.  I feel that the layout of the web page and the design could be improved.  It seems kind of like a template was used to create the webpage and the same color is used too much.  Try varying the colors and a more unique webpage design to set the website apart from others.
945,"It looks well laid-out and professional. I feel that I'd have no issues navigating the site, as it is very clear. The color is easy on the eyes and catches attention. I think it is great as it is and do not have any suggestions for improvement, but it may be worth stating I have never studied design and love the color green."
954,"The design is visually boring. It appears that the comments are a chance for folks to interact instead of talking with one another on the phone. Not sure if this feature is really necessary. I would like to see some information on this page about how the money transfers/users' information is kept secure. I might also like a chart or table that shows money transfers, as opposed to a running list of prose; it looks kind of like facebook. Other than that, it's an intriguing service. "
955,I love everything about this exept for the placing of the time/place... not the Time/Place: at the top but rather the actual listings of them. I think they are to far to the middle I would have then listed directly below the time/place: .
958,"The overall look is a little cheap. I really like the ""GO AHEAD"" logo and I would like to see it incorporated into more of the overall design. The ""GO AHEAD"" logo style feels fresh and exciting. I would like to see a little less green in the design - perhaps have the shades of green serve as accent colors."
959,The comment interface looks too generic. It looks like spam.
961,"The silhouette of the man and woman dancing is a little difficult to figure out, so I would use a different graphic.  The colors don't seem to harmonize so I would use a different contrast color than the violet.  Don't Italicize everything in the last paragraph."
963,The text is too small. There is too much to read and its hard to differentiate between the relative importance of items. 
968,"I like the layout, but I don't like the purple.  It makes the whole thing look dark.  I think if it had some brighter colors it would stand out more and catch peoples attention.  Maybe the time and place should be a little bigger also.  That should be the main focus in my opinion."
970,I think it would be a good idea to change this picture to a group picture with two or more diverse people.
970,This image of school events should be larger.
970,This image is a bit cluttered and confusing for the home page. I would suggest placing it on another page. 
970,"The gradient color is a bit distracting here, and also the green. There's too much green and white everywhere. It's great to see the school colors, but no so much. Suggest black here. "
970,"Not sure why this section is also gradient, grey, and red. I think this should actually be black with white text or something along those lines."
971,"Finally, this is much better than using paypal to send money. Make sure pay and charge has a limit set for it so users can't accidentally enter an extremely high amount by accident. I don't see an option near it to pick who I want to send money to or charge. So maybe a list of your friends to choose from would be helpful. Maybe doing it via their profile would be okay, too. The invitation to friends makes me question whether or not it works because it's just text you click when a button is generally used for a form. I'm not sure what the checklist is for either, but that's another story."
972,The overall design is bland. The colors are too muted and somber. The social media icons are defaults and are too generic. There needs to be some texture to the background and a more interesting font used. It needs character and the sense that it was created by a human being and not simply typed into an existing website template. The upper banner needs some depth and the logo is a bit too flat looking also and needs a gradient or something to make it more visually interesting..
975,"Important
"
975,Always important
975,Always want to know when comments I make are public.
975,Knowing who my friends are is important.
975,Comments by friends always important.
977,"This needs to be more dynamic to encourage interest.
"
977,"This should be bigger and brighter.
"
977,"I think the logo should be more prominent.
"
977,"I think this should be in the left hand information section.
"
977,"This could be with the campus events section.
"
977,"I'm not sure what the purpose of this is.  Is it for future students?
"
978,"I think it's a fine flyer, very straight forward, very direct. The title portion could be a bit larger and maybe you could do something to make a date time and location a bit more prominent. "
981,"The overall design of the website is very clean and nicely set up. The page is easy to navigate without too much going on. You might want to offer a direct link to maps to visit the college. You also might want to offer a direct hit for employment opportunities on the homepage. I'm not sure if this college offers a specific email opportunity for their current students, but if they do, it might be nice to have a direct link for them to click on and access the web portal. One more suggestion, if you have any facebook, twitter or other media accounts you might want to offer a ""stay connected option"" at the bottom for people to click on and go directly to seeing your pages."
982,The page appears to be refreshingly uncluttered. The links are intuitive. I don't feel as though I'd be bumbling around trying to find the relevant information. The colors are pleasing. The font size appears to be adequate for most people to read easily.
987,picture was not so attractive
987,design have to improve
987,text was not readable
987,design was not good
990,"The overall color scheme is good, but the gradient on the left side makes it look a bit cheap. I'd also recommend reconsidering the font use in the text; this looks slightly unprofessional. I think there's too much white space in the bottom."
992,"have more of the information and links at the left side of the site and not at the bottom. i would put the ""get started here"" link at the very top of the page and make the letters much larger. Also, maybe show more pictures of students and faculty."
1003,have to improve the picture
1003,design was not good
1003,design was not good
1003,cant able to read text
1003,font was too small
1005,The text is too small
1005,I can't read the place!
1005,Does this say TBD?
1005,"The top half of this illustration is good, the bottom is muddled."
1005,"I like the colors but there is too much black/background,"
1014,"At first glance, I am a little confused to be honest. I am not 100% sure of the concept. I get that you can request money from others or pay others. It seems like a twitter or facebook except it is to send/receive money. I think the concept appears simple but I'm not sure how many people would want a public newsfeed of this. "
1016,"The design is very attractive and colorful. The purple color makes it unique and more appealing to me. And the combination of a black background, purple and yellow is strikingly beautiful. None of the colors are blinding. The poster does a great job at alternating the font size and boldness. The poster mentions all the information that I like to read in such posters, including the exact date, time and place. And it mentions what it could be expected by attending the dance show including the free dance lessons with 4 styles of ballroom dance. I sincerely like the poster."
1019,"-Too much 1 color (green)
-I can't see the add words very well at the bottom left part of the screen (the date)
-A ""contact us"" link should be included in the quick links somewhere on the page
"
1020,There are too many side bar announcements. 
1020,The text markers here are small. 
1020,This image space can be better proportioned with respect to the rest of the sections. 
1020,Maybe make these announcements a gallery style section. 
1020,Consider a different color scheme that goes better with the green school colors. 
1022,The background color is fully black and may change that color which is pleasing. Some decorations to be filled with music instruments and other things which related to the dance show which could exaggerate the advertisement better.
1025,"When the image first came on the screen, my first thought was that it was for Girl Scout Cookies. (Sorry!) To be honest, this really does not give the impression of an institution of higher learning, but more of a club. Maybe toning down the color scheme and showing more of a college type image rather than a young girl in a tee shirt would give a better, more formal/professional impression. "
1027,I think a little more color besides black and green would improve things somewhat. The design is very dull. 
1030,It is good to let the audience know exactly what is going on. 
1030,It is good to get brand name out there. 
1030,It is good placement to let audience know all specific details. 
1030,Change the color. 
1032,The colors does not go well together.Green color does not suite for this site.Because of the color the site is not attractive or grab our attention.
1036,"I like the silhouette design.  I think there is too much empty space for the image, maybe raise the dancers below the title."
1039,The lay out is pretty basic. Maybe try adding some more color to the site. It would be best if there was a couple of default avatars for users. I don't know if it's set to that one avatar just as a placement but I wouldn't use that avatar on the actual site. The check list section should maybe be actual boxes that are checked off inside of a sliding scale like you have here. Other than that I am okay with the way this page is set up.
1041,"The color scheme really looks rather old. Beige and green looks rather drab, the font choice also looks rather bad. The pictures used on the left side look bad, especially the parkland red one really stands out and looks rather geocities-ish. I would take all navigation on the page and put it toward the top to condense everything."
1043,There is a lack of privacy.  It looks too much like Facebook's interface.  I'm worried about the site being used for illegal purposes.
1044,Leave a comment to let your friend know you enjoyed receiving their hard earned money.
1046,The overall color is not appealing and difficult to read. I would change the entire color theme and consider much lighter background.
1048,I think this area is well done.  It is exactly what I would expect and is in line with other colleges.  I like that it gives me choices of directed content based on who I am.
1048,"Not sure what this is for.  If this is custom content for current students it seems a little repetitive of the ""information for"" section above"
1048,"Campus events should be moved up and placed more centrally with brighter design.  You could add the events listed on the left to make the space and bump ""in the news"" down there.  I think prospective and current students would be the most frequent visitors and would find this the most useful"
1048,"""grow"" doesn't really seem to fit the ""go ahead"" part of the design with the forward arrow. It's just kind of dangling here.  "
1048,Add a location & map link
1052,"The color purple makes me think Northwestern, not UofI.  I think you should use orange for school spirit.  

Otherwise, I like the overall design.  I think the silhouette of the dancers could refined.  I can see some residual white edges around the purple.   I would move the block of text starting with ""join us..."" down a little bit so its more evenly spaced between the text above and the bottom of the poster."
1053,I think its not a good practice that our friends can see my financial transaction. I wouldn't want my friends to see my financial transactions.
1056,"The font color in the bottom being grey is a little difficult to read, also using numbers instead of words looks a little tacky. The font used is too stock, and the photo is too clipart. I think spending a little more and having a better artist illustrate something unique will be more captivating.  "
1058,Text should be bigger
1058,Image is too large
1058,These should be added the to the above links
1060,"seems clear and navigable. bottom left (go ahead... need extra...) seems unnecessary, or at least could be replaced with a simple link. The 'Go Ahead >' theme in general seems a bit over done. Also, you might want to add info about student housing available in the area."
1062,there is too much green and very less faces for representing different diversities .
1063,"I feel there are to many different shades of green.
"
1065,"The text beginning with ""Join us..."" is harder to read because of font color. I like the design of the couple dancing; it's intriguing and let's me know what to expect. ""Location TBD"" is off-putting. When will the location be determined, and how will that information be communicated? I'm not crazy about the contrasting justification of the text blocks beginning with ""7 p.m. Friday..."" and ""Join us...""; it looks a bit sloppy."
1067,"Empty space on bottom left hand side, is not looking good.
Purpose of ""Go Ahead"" on left hand side is defeated when it is already highlighted on the page. Instead, increase the font size of topics under ""INFORMATION FOR"" and remove the ""Go Ahead"" on left hand side"".

Otherwise good and simple design."
1071,"Looks outdated. Background colors of black and purple are not eye-catching. Information is hard to see, needs larger font. "
1072,This looks very simple to use.
1072,I like that the amount is easy to find
1075,"I really like the poster, but I think it would be beneficial to change the font size of the date and time to something that stands out (a bright, bold font would work well).  Also, the September 1st date should really have a location prior to printing and hanging the posters.  Finally, the text at the bottom is very difficult to read due to the color of the font - that should be brightened."
1076,"I think the bottom portion could use some filling-out, and some color.  Right now, it looks like one of those pages you get when you type in the wrong address for a website, and GoDaddy, or whoever is advertising for the domain name to be bought.  The Bottom right-hand section that's gray looks like those deceptive advertisement links that are so ubiquitous on the net.   "
1078,"I don't like the font it is too stale and dates.  Also the yellow color on the font is gross.  I like the sillouhettes, but not really a fan of the color.  I think red would be better."
1080,GO Ahead seems very disconnected from grow. The text isn't well balanced.
1080,Campus Arts Events section deserves more prominence.
1080,Extra links in this menu like and Events calendar and a map could be good.
1080,"Logo looks professional, but reminds me of a bank or law firm, for some reason. "
1080,The color scheme of these boxes seems drab abnd out of place with all the nice greens.
1080,I think the photo is good. Racial and gender diversity is nice. But maybe another image with multiple students? Promote a sense of community.
1084,simple sleek design looks easy enough to use to transfer money
1087,"Super application
EaSY TO Pay"
1087,Procedure is little clumsy
1087,Wow..Charging also easy
1087,Its very useful to pay and charge
1089,"I like the number and organization of the links and having different ways of organizing things, by visitor type on the left, and by subject type on top, while also having a drop-down menu for quicklinks.  I think that the idea behind the design is solid, however, the design comes off a little segmented and boxy.  The idea of listing news and campus events is good, but it feels visually distinct from the rest of the site.  Plus, I don't know what the large center image is referring to, future or current students.  And finally, bottom left box is unnecessary filler and visually distracts from the rest of the design."
1091,It is a good design but i have some suggestions change the theme color green to blue then change the lady in the pic add a cute girl
1097,"I like the header, and the silhouette of the dancers is well done, too. But I think the text on the left-hand side should align better, everything just appears to float independently, which I know is intentional, but in this case, it doesn't look quite right. If it were up to me, I'd make the poster narrower, and place the location and description as a more compact single column."
1098,"I like this section.  It looks nice.
"
1098,This area is just about right.  Not too many categories.
1098,Could do without the Go Ahead and Arrow.  Should just say Visit Us.
1098,Shouldn't say Go Ahead again.  That's just a repeat of above.  Doesn't look right.  Get ahead is out of place too.
1098,This menu looks OK.
1098,Good message:  Go Ahead Grow.  Looks good.
1098,Color doesn't match the rest.
1103,Very interesting design. Contrast colors attract attention. I may propose to change text layout for better separation of information
1104,change the font color to black
1108,Face should be more attractive and need multi colour 
1109,"The clip art figures are just bad, you could easily put a quality photo in that space. Lot of black negative space and the grey text on the black background on the lower right doesn't pop out or catch the eye at all, and the tan letters aren't much better on a black background. Looks like something cheap and from the early 90's design era."
1114,"Site is very well laid out with a clean design that's easy to read, understand and navigate.The text colors come off the background very well and show good readability. I work on sites and I don't really see anything that I would change at all except for the wasted space at the bottom of the left column, make that a dynamic box to end where the widget ends, or use that space for another widget, maybe some social media links because they're important to that age group."
1116,"Below in the news and campus events red color fonts are used it is not look good use font color white .
and in the left side at bottom the last part are not looking good please use the different image .
at left side - coming to parkland is in green color use the black color.
"
1117,"I feel like there is a lot of small text all over this page and it's a little hard to find what you need right away. I think the ""In the News"" and ""Campus Events"" don't really necessarily need to be displayed on the home page, they just kind of add clutter to an already busy page. The layout with the different boxes feels a little unorganized and the ads on the left side are a little strange as well. I would make the subjects on top in the dark green boxes a lot bigger since they are probably the most important and what people will be searching for the most. "
1118,looks like facebook (not good)
1122,"The letter head is really very good
"
1122,The navigation is easy and simple
1122,The colors and font style is attractive.
1123,The design looks very much professional and attractive. The navigation is also very simple. The design is already very good and there is no need for improvement.
1124,The face of the model is clear
1124,The navigation area is simply good.
1124,Perfect location to post
1127,"The Design of the website is good and accurate, but still it need some more improvement, description are below.
1) It is good to see the Video of any grand events or any similar to this is more attractive than a plain Homepage.
2) The Student Life section should looks more familiar.
3) The Webpage looks good if you add site map/navigation for your address, this will help full for far away students to reach-out without any interference.
4) Add more Section or Headlines
5) Add Feedback Section for Student Life."
1128,"Clean design and I do enjoy the colors. However, it does look a bit Facebook-ish to me. I think the Like button is redundant. Making the Public, Friends, and Mine buttons more visible. I also wouldn't want my other friends to know about my transactions. Are there options for privacy?"
1130,"Clean design, but Public, Friends, and Mine buttons could be more visible. It looks too similar to Facebook. Omitting the Like button would help. I also wonder if there are privacy options, because I would not want my other friends to see my transactions."
1133,"I think they could make it look a bit more professional in order to attract students. To me, the fonts and layout are a bit juvenile and not college looking"
1134,"Links for older Achievements can be provided.Also ""Contact us"" link which re-directs to phone number and email address should be provided."
1137,Dance open house 2015 must be written in same colour(violet). In 7 pm Friday August 28 7 I'd not clearclear. While providing address please include the city and state for more proper address 
1139,"I can see the white spots from editing the purple/black cut-outs of the people that are dancing. I'm not sure if it's just the tint from my computer screen, but the color of ""OPEN HOUSE 2015"" is not a pleasant color to look at. It hurts my eyes and would immediately make me want to stop looking at it. I would suggest making that specific text a little bit darker to seem more appealing."
1145,"IF YOU VIEW YOUR COLLEGE BUILDING FACILITY THAT IS LAB , CLASSROOM, AND STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM IT WILL BE MORE ATTRACTED."
1147,The writings are very formal.Putting some emoji would help.background color and the couple color does not blend well.
1149,"I like the logo at the top. The font for it is really nice, as is the spacing of the words but I don't like the space between the very top of the image and the beginning of the logo. I also feel as if there is too much space between the end of the text and bottom of the image. The art in the image is nice and I like the colors, it does have some strange white spots on it, though."
1150,Another banner or upcoming event should be here to take advantage of the open menu.
1150,"This should be a more noticeable graphic, but the color difference in ""COMING TO PARKLAND?"" is a nice touch without it."
1153,some what clear image needed
1153,characters need to be in small font size
1153,not clear
1153,it can be enlarged and move at the top corner
1153,menu looks very nice
1153,this area can be larger in size
1153,this area looks very shaded.it can be colored differently in bright manner
1157,"I think the design, and layout is fresh and appealing. I would definitely be persuaded to check these programs out.
"
1159,"The color scheme of the design needs a little bit improvement. See various poster in Google you will find the best color schemes. In this color scheme you want to keep black background, then you should also present some part of the poster in shining pink colors. There is no shine as this is a ball room dance program. See the url image below, you will get more clear idea of color schemes.

Url: http://www.utahballroom.org/files/concerts/2008/UVU_WinterConcert08_Poster.jpg"
1161,i don't like this background color so try to change the color
1164,"I like the different shades of green as the main focus color. I also like that there is color contrast, especially how the color of the lettering in the ""In the News"" and ""Campus Events"" columns coordinate with the image in the lower left corner. There are issues with that for me though, for some reason, the lettering in that particular color is more difficult to read that the other small lettering. Maybe it should be larger or brighter? To elaborate on the lower left corner, it seems the info that appears to give dates on a Shakespeare performance (hard to read) should be larger-it just makes sense to expand it and fill the empty tan space below it rather than cramping so much info into a too-small space. I also feel like there should be more info on the main page regarding the institute instead of just it's name, ideally a location(s, if applicable), along with pertinent address info and telephone numbers where calls with general questions can be directed and subsequently routed to the correct dept. at the school."
1168,Too much space being taken up by the graphic and not enough interactive elements like a video.  Id make the site have more useful information right away directing people based on what group of people they are.
1169,"comments on other people's transactions? don't understand why someone would want to do that, you pay because you need to pay for something, it;s not like expressing an opinion or participating in a conversation"
1169,"these 'progress' bars are really annoying, I know that it supposed to be an encouragement to part with my private details, but it;s just getting boring and repetitive to see it on every site"
1169,"don't really understand the concept of revealing how much I pay to whom, seems like a really poor excuse for another clone of 'social' network site"
1170,This link is unnecessary. There is already a search box on the left that allows people to search their friends. 
1170,There is no privacy on this page. I am able to see so many transactions of my friends. Only my transactions should be visible on this page. 
1171,"The font  color is not very good,my point view it should be black"
1171,logo is in right section but some changes is require in logo
1171,I think menus is not placed in right format
1180,"Looking nice design. In my suggestion Please try to different font on ("" Join us .... across 4 styles of ballroom Dance!""). Please highlight this. Time and place put in to bottom. Also, Logo much bigger its good."
1182,"I feel the design is basic, maybe too basic. I think some more colorful or interesting graphics would make this plain page look more inviting."
1186,"The overall color and design is good and neat, But it will be more attractive if you choose some dark colors."
1193,very easy to understand and fulfill the needs.Also good look and design.
1196,"I like that it is simple but I feel it would work better if the colors contrasted each other in a better fashion. Perhaps use one brighter or livelier color? I also felt the details under time/place would look better if it was aligned to the left and maybe boldened. 
 "
1199,The content of the letters and font should me improved otherwise it is cool and simple.
1202,The logo should be bigger and not off to the corner.
1202,Her smile looks fake. Maybe someone a bit more realistic should be used. How about a group of students to show diversity. 
1210,the background should be little more colourful and can apply little more design also.
1213,design is absolutely good and entertaining and it looks attractive.Nothing should be improved in my opinion.
1215,"It looks very boring, the color scheme is dull and there's no sense of interactivity."
1217,The website is too greenish. Color should be changed. Font is small. Size of font should be increased. Underlines in the 'In the news' and 'campus events'  sections should be avoided.
1219,"I would consolidate the options on the left (Information For:) into the Quicklinks drop-down, and move the options at the top right (Experience Parkland, etc.) to the left of the page. This would lead to a less-cluttered layout. The Shakespeare banner is busy and the text is too small. Overall the site is run of the mill and not offensive, but could be cleaner-looking."
1224,The way that all of this stuff is line up seems choppy. I would work on how this space is used.
1224,"Move this to the right to line up with the information text above it (place/location info). Right-align, maybe?"
1224,Can't read text in logo
1224,"There's a weird, faint, white line here?"
1225,I would use a more festive font or perhaps be more colorful do advertise for something like a dance 
1225,Why is this in itallics?
1225,This should be larger text and a more contrasting color to the black background.  
1225,"If you're limited on the colors you can use, I'd pick something besides light purple.  Otherwise, I would redesign this with more than two colors, or pick a color that is both warm and bright. "
1225,"How do you find out where TBD will be?  There is no website or contact info on this poster
"
1225,"Is this part of the logo?  If not, why is this double vertical line floating here?"
1232,excellent
1232,very clear
1232,very clear
1232,"I feel this area looks too informal and crowded like social media feed, that's a turn off. I don't want public and private options either."
1232,This is nice and clear
1232,Not sure what this does exactly
1232,I don't want money pages to look ike facebook and I don't want too much info on the page.Just the transactions.
1234,Good One. Placing College Campus Photo Will Be An Added Advantage. Thanks.
1235,The background can be given different color.
1235,The logo is very nice and it is simple
1235,I might have chosen different color for him
1235,Hand is very simple it can be given different color at wrist
1235,Remove the empty space
1235,No need of empty pace
1235,I like the font very much
1238,Thanks.
1238,Profile Picture Should Be Must And It Should Be Authenticated.
1238,Help With Scroll Down Options
1238,Website Can Be More Colourful/Informative for a professional Approach. 
1240,make this a brighter color so it shines above everything else on the flyer.
1240,i like the design on the partners dancing but some if it seems a little sketchy try to sharpen it up.
1240,make it big enough to stand out and be remembered.
1245,black colors to be changed to multi colors
1252,"I like the color a lot.
"
1252,good solid logo.
1253,I don't like the color scheme. I understand they went with shades of green because its parkland and all that but its still just seems boring to me. could use a little variety 
1254,The hair protrudes a little too much.
1254,"I really like the interplay here, with the switching of positive and negative space."
1254,I feel like there needs to be a bit more space between these two words.
1254,Consider aligning these left.
1254,"Either this is an old poster, or it needs to be updated for the current year."
1255,"The text could be a little bigger here
"
1260,"The design looks simple and easy to understand. The pay/charge options at the top center is convenient and allows easy access to the most important feature. There seems to be a lot of empty space to the right of the list of friends' payments that seems a little distracting, maybe the table could be shrunk or the size of each item could be increased (text size, image size, etc?). There don't seem to be any buttons to 'send' things (ie it looks like comments are submitted by typing the comment then hitting enter) which might confuse some users who are less tech savvy than others. It's difficult to comment on the design of the pay/charge buttons without a working demo but the critique is the same. Overall this is a straightforward and well designed page."
1262,For some reason it looks too much like Facebook. It would be nice if the interface is more differentiated.
1263,"Is this for the name of the ""someone"" or the amount that is being paid/charged?  Maybe specify with ""Amount to pay or charge someone"" or ""Person to pay or charge something."""
1263,"Are these the only social media options available, or are others (such as LinkedIn) available if the specific user links them to his profile?  Maybe add an option to ""View More"" or for the user, ""Add More""/""Connect An Account"" if he wants to."
1263,"Is this a link to the user's profile?  Specify this - ""Milford Meade's Profile"" or ""My Profile"" would be helpful."
1263,"It mentions what is next, but does not give an obvious indicator what the user has previously completed.  To help them remember where they left off on the checklist, maybe add ""JUST FINISHED: <previous task>"" above or below ""NEXT UP: <next task>."""
1263,"Also allow users to have ""Friend Groups"" so they can sort their friends.  It could be a link right next to or below this ""Friends"" link, just to make it easier to find a specific friend."
1265,"the small letters in white colors should be still bright, green color background should be changed to still light"
1266,"""Illini Dancesport"" and ""Dance"" should be on separate lines, because they blend together a bit. I feel as if the Time/Place information could be formatted a bit better. The information blends together. It might be best to left justify that information, instead of right justifying it (which ends up being in the center of the page)."
1270,"This area is clickable but it isn't clear where it goes to.
"
1270,"A link like this, for prospective students, should be prioritized more. This is small and should be larger and given more emphasis.
"
1271,her teeth look a little yellowed
1274,I'd clean up the dancing couple image a bit. It looks like somebody rushed through it. List the styles of dance that the lessons will teach
1275,"Definitely could have a dynamic main image that slides with different content.
"
1275,Space here can be used for something.
1275,Dates could be useful for how recent the news is
1277,"I like the way it feels like a facebook design, it makes it feel familiar. A different color would be nice, however. That blue is very over used. Also I hate getting started checklists. Especially because if you don't particularly want to bug friends to join it just sits there forever so some way to dismiss it would be nice. Or at least not have the ""Invite some friends item.""  But otherwise, looks very interesting and intuitive."
1280,This area should be aligned to the left instead of out of sync.  
1280,There is too much open space here
1280,It would have been more classy to use a simple black and white image and make the image smoother.  It's too jagged.
1280,"There is a lot of empty space here, but the black is elegant"
1280,Keep text to one color
1280,White text would be better rather than a variety of colors
1280,Your logo should be larger in order to draw the eye in and create interest in the organization.  You want people to remember it!
1284,"Very plain, color does not go well with green above
"
1284,"Weird design. The GO AHEAD, and then all lower case grow....could be done better"
1284,May be better to show a group of students in a natural campus setting..
1284,Should have address at the bottom along with phone number
1284,"Wasted space, ugly color"
1288,I think the ad should be of real people. It should be more fun and colorful too to show how fun dance can be
1291,"Lighter Back Round
"
1291,Nicer Design 
1291,the brand name is not indicative of financial services offered
1291,colours look like paypal or facebook and they need to be different
1294,"The design works like a social media, so it is possible for people to plant a virus in the profile using the comment section and then hack the account easily. Also, as compared to user, some people don't want transfer of amount to be associated with social media, as they don't want to tell others why they transferred or how much they transferred ."
1298,Important
1298,I hope there a security setting here because I don't want everyone to see what I'm buying
1298,Looks too much like twitter or facebook.  Change the layout or colors.
1300,Background color should be a different color. black is so boring
1300,Needs more description to make people want to attend.
1301,"I'd much rather have a date and time stamp showing when payment was sent, versus the social media style of ""30 minutes ago,"" ""2 days ago"" etc. It comes across as unprofessional and makes it harder to track. "
1304,"I don't care for the graphic of the two people dancing, it seems too amateur for me. It isn't a good pic in silhouette. Also, the date and time should be much bigger so it catches peoples attention right away. Also, the word ""Ballroom"" should be more prominently featured in the Header, or Title of this poster. "
1307,"I really like this design. There's only two minor things that I'd adjust and fix. For starters, there's specs of white in the purple that are unattractive & really stand out against the perfectly smooth, black background. I'd also choose a lighter shade of grey for the ""Join us for an evening of..."" section to make it better stand out in poorly lit areas or students with difficulty seeing (for any reason.) Possibly even a lighter shade of purple to compliment the art & ""DANCE""? "
1310,This is decent.  The colors do pop and it's  simple. 
1311,I'm not sure why their needs to be a social media money exchanger?  Why do we need to see friends??
1311,I'm not understanding this either. Am I actually supposed to comment on people's money exchanges? I'm not sure that would work or catch on.
1311,I see what you're going for but the facebook of money exchanges just doesn't seem like it would be a hit. I wouldn't use it.
1311,"Find friends should show how you can actually find friends, email? name?"
1311,"I'd move the text over slightly, it looks like there is a bit too much space next to the logo even though it's probably the same as the right."
1314,"I like the top half. It's easy to read and eye-pleasing. The follow text on the right side, bottom half could be better placed. The text choice makes it look amatuer-ish. I would pick and stick with one font for the information. 

The silhouettes is a bit messy, you can see where the poor clipping is, the edges that show some white. It should be better cleaned up.

I like the color scheme, the light purple and yellow.  "
1317,"I am not sure what this does.
"
1317,"I like the simple layout, but looking so much like facebook makes me not trust it."
1318,"Maybe add a little separation between ""dancesport"" and ""dance"" to make it a little more clear"
1319,"The default avatar seems a bit dark. It could be lighter, possibly with more color. The Pay and Charge buttons would stand out more if they had bright colors."
1320,"I would personally stick to one solid color instead of  the links having a gradient background and the overall background being a gradient. A good idea would be to take the gradient background off of the links and choosing a solid color that matches the entire cells gradient, that would show up on link hover. Otherwise the rest of the design looks nice. "
1325,"Too many different colors of green; choose a more concise palette and then stick with it. The menu items on the top left probably shouldn't not be gradiented because they don't clearly indicate their functionality. A better choice would be to have them all be consistent color when not moused-over and then turn a different shade when an individual one IS moused-over. Finally, what's up with the background being a gradient itself? There are more than enough gradients on the page already, it feels reallllly overboard."
1328,"I don't think I would have picked the color scheme of black and purple. It should be more vibrant, in my opinion."
1328,This wall of text is kind of just on the background and does not really stand out to be read easily.
1329,"If the poster is meant to be for students interested in ballroom dancing then that should be mentioned before mentioning ""dance performances"". People that are interested are probably more interested in the lessons and might be thrown off if they don't read the whole sign such as on the way to class. The font color for the ""join us"" part seems dark and should be brought to the forefront of the poster with a brighter color."
1334,I really like the overall color scheme but I see there are some slight issues with the icon in the right hand corner. If you look close you can see white splotches where if looks like the black background was suppose to fill in and it wasn't done very sharp or blended together.
1338,"There are some white specks surrounding the silhouette of the man and woman dancing. Doesn't make it look to professional. Fill in the white specks around the hand, head, neck, and collar of the man. Also, not quite sure what the white double vertical line is to the right of the logo. It seems out of place and holds no relevance. "
1340,Change the colors
1341,Even though it's done by a lot of websites theres is a reason most websites put the profile info and everything that goes with it on the left side it makes it easier to seperate it from the actual page in your mind when reading left to right. Other than that. It has a nice color scheme and an easy to understand interface.
1342,Change the colors
1345,"I think it needs an obvious way of making a transaction private, for one. It seems a little unpolished overall, but very clean, simple, and easily understandable."
1348,Make sure there is some way to make the payment transfers hidden so that you don't automatically show everyone who you are giving money to.
1351,Does this verify its users? I see that having a picture isnt required and that makes me believe it doesn't verify.
1362,"The outline of the dancers on the bottom left is a bit strange looking to me. In order to use that art on the design, I would make it a bit smaller and move it more towards the top of the page, near the top text. I would then remove the excess black space form the bottom of the design. Perhaps more vibrant, yet very similar, colors would also help make the design more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, I think that the design serves it's purpose well. "
1363,"This application looks like just chat application,there is no way one can determine how trusted this application to deal with monetary transactions in a secure way,how safe it is?there should some information how many successful transactions have completed until now in a secure manner.There should be some trusted symbol or verified by some agency to give authorization,trust and about safety to people who want to do monetary transaction. "
1365,"I don't like the slogan
"
1365,need more color differentiation
1365,"aesthetics of this top bar is terrible. 
"
1367,It is very simple and very nice. I like how the dancers stand out. They are in motion and the color is very nice also.
1370,I actually use venmo and absolutely love it. I don't think anything needs to be changed. Maybe change the blue in the names to a little darker
1371,"Maybe the amount transferred should be listed in the timeline displayed on this page. Although I guess this is showing transfers between people that is not the user logged in, so I guess that wouldn't make sense. It is a little too close to Facebook. Maybe something should be done to distinguish it. It may look better without the borders around the timeline. "
1374,"The design is fine but the picture of the dancing people looks low quality and weird with all the white spots on it, it should be cleaned up. Also more information might be helpful."
1375,"Font style can be improved, some stylish font style, colours are not very much attractive. For lavender colour logo, font styles can be matched as navy blue or violet.The logo should be fixed in right side top corner and should be maximised.  Dance Openhouse 2015 should be centered and should come in second line"
1377,"I like the design, but the lines could be a lot smoother. Seems like there's too much white in it? Or is it just my computer. "
1383,its looks bad.this page was not attractive
1388,I like the overall design but since my favorite color is blue I would rather see the blue on black background as the main theme. The image of the couple dancing could also be sharper and clearer. There is also a lot of blank space that could be utilized by making the text font bigger.
1390,"I like the over all design but I would like to see a bit more variation in color and font sizes or styles.   It is rather plain in a bad way.   And, I am not sure if this is supposed to be a donation site or a money transfer site more akin to Western Union.   But, I am not sure I would like a facebook style wall to communicate with friends about borrowing or giving money.    I think there would need to be a greater degree of privacy and security. 

"
1392,"color not attractive!
"
1392,"text appears dim.
 "
1392,options not mentioned
1392,"Instagram can be added
"
1392,Google plus can be added
1392,You Tube channel can be added
1392,Use bigger font
1392,Brighten the color
1406,"Tim Horine
"
1409,I've never been a big fan on the social media aspect on many sites nowadays. I feel like the main page here should be simpler and at least show the dollar amount that was transferred to a person.
1410,The ad is nice but there is no name of choreography who is goi to teach .no name of a performer.there is no detail of type of dance .this ad should include more detail of dance lesson n dance teacher .the ad should include contact no so that peiple can call and get more details .
1412,"How secure are the transfers?  Does your info have to show or can it be hidden?
"
1414,Does this site use facebook to find your friends?
1420,"slightly bigger font, add a little orange to compliment all the blue."
1421,"change font style , font color
"
1421,"move the entire line to top left corner , it seem more better."
1421,move this logo to top right corner .
1421,change background color to Dull Black.
1421,this was good.
1421,it was good .
1421,move this paragraph a little bit down 
1421,"change tie color , prefer dull color , it it doesn't match remove tie from the art  , just keep the neck collor."
1421,"put the logo here in dull white color , or transparent ."
1421,add rose flower to the women art at hair
1421,add wrist watch.
1421,add music symbol.
1422,It would be nice to see what has already been completed on the checklist and what is left going forward.
1422,It would be helpful to see peoples names under their picture here.
1422,The below thread reminds me of facebook which seems reliable
1423,"It is unattractive. According to my opinion, you have to have colour combination. you have to change logo and gives 3d look to logo.  "
1426,looks like facebook
1426,looks like kick starter
1427,I wouldn't want people seeing who I am paying
1428,try to reduce the size of this so that the other image get more space
1428,use big size font for easy noticing
1438,"Pay and charge buttons should be color coded like Pay bright green and charge bright brown.
Text in the other tabs like home, find friends is too small, it should be larger.
There should be a favorite tab in which regularly used members can be saved.

"
1453,Remove the invite friends requirement; I know waht the site is meant for but it shouldn't be required.
1453,Have an option to remove comments; just say who paid who.
1458,"Clean and simple design, what about the color green instead, since its about money after all.It appears that you can like status's but you cannot share them. I think the design is familiar, it just needs to be a little more exciting. There doesn't seem to be anything going on. A younger audience would be quite bored."
1459,I'm not sure how this differs from the box below where you type a name.
1459,I think the entire friend feed is unnecessary. It's no one else's business who pays whom and I am not interested in the commentary.
1459,"Same thing here - I don't think there's a need to ""friendify"" or ""social"" this app."
1465,"wasted space
"
1465,maybe a different set of dancers
1465,use a better color and make font bigger
1465,use a different color
1465,I like the background color
1466,"I think this should be ""four"" instead of ""4.""  It would be more elegant."
1466,I'm not sure about the white and yellow.  I think it should be one or the other . 
1466,"I think this logo is very well-done.  Overall, the poster is very good."
1476,Perhaps not as much focus on this one girl and more of a group effort or a student standing would be better.
1476,Nice gradient here! Looks very smooth.
1477,I like this but think it should go underneath the pay/charge option.
1477,The whole profile bar should be in the center above pay/charge for better convenience.
1480,A way contact the organizers to get information
1480,Use different colors for the man and the lady to differentiate their silhouette. 
1480,Name the 4 styles of ballroom dance
1481,"Theres a lot of green at the top of the page. Different elements blend together.
"
1481,"Theres a lot of green at the top of the page. Different elements blend together.
"
1481,The arrow to the left focuses attention on this picture. I think something more relevant would be better suited than one individual girl
1482,"There are white spots all in this, might want to remake or improve this design."
1482,"Bring this text down a bit, and pull it to the right a tad."
1482,Increase logo size
1482,"Need's some sort of contact information
"
1482,Purple color works very well with the color scheme
1483,what?
1484,is Deadpool currency?
1484,"can I randomly charge people stuff?
"
1485,"One hand is purple, the other black, would look better if his hand on her back was purple with a black outline."
1485,this logo is too small to read the text
1485,"to be determined is too vague, there needs to be a phone number to call somewhere on the poster
"
1485,"both have a starting time, but what is the ending time ?"
1489,too boring... need pics
1491,Nice logo
1491,Is this animated? Looks cool.
1495,"Already have a ""Visit us here"" which is the same thing
"
1496,I feel like this newsfeed really isn't necessary. I wouldn't want my other friends to know that I sent money. That's private to me.
1496,The design is very nice for the website overall. It looks very professional.
1497,"I'd move this to the bottom

"
1497,"This area should be on the left. This is valuable wasted space. 
"
1497,"Wasted space
"
1497,This should be the banner going across the top
1498,Really like this picture here
1498,Maybe make the word free bigger
1498,Put something here to show off the fact that this is all free
1498,I would put the time and place last. Put the fun information up top
1499,User photos should not be required; my offline identity is intentionally private. There are other ways of verifying ID.
1499,Add Google+ or even LinkedIn.
1499,"If this is similar to a Facebook status update that everyone can see, at least make it optional to display items purchased.  This should not be required to be public."
1502,Too much empty space here.
1502,too much empty space in this section.
1505,too much empty space here.
1505,too much empty space.
1506,These boxes being stacked vertically looks unappealing. The grid view is not good
1506,What is this blank space for? The color doesn't match anything either
1506,Campus events and In the news section is nice but hyperlinks could use more information other than just headlines
1507,"Don't leave the ""OPEN HOUSE 2015"" text so thin - make it wider if possible, it looks really cramped.
"
1507,"I can see where you're going artistically with this, but this dance motif just looks really weird with the black overlays.  Consider changing that."
1507,Establish a location first.
1507,Wall of text isn't a good idea - use bullet points!
1507,"Strange alignment of text, consider aligning to the left"
1507,"""ILLINI"" - ?  Is this a colloquially used abbreviation for Illinois?"
1507,Text is way too small.
1510,"the color is too neutral
"
1510,I do not like the color
1510,there should be a FAQ page
1510,"I like this feature very useful , provides confidence in use"
1510,"I think the option add photo It should not be available here ,only in account settings"
1510,in the white area seems a little too empty
1514,I dont like the positioning of the name of the company and how it is lined up with DANCE It would look better placed higher
1515,Require a user to have a profile picture.  That way its more secure since you know who the other person is.  
1515,"I dont like these bars, it makes me feel like something is incomplete with my account.
"
1516,This whole lower right are is ugly and plain.
1516,The font color doesn't work well with the green theme
1516,The whole bottom half of the page feels wasted. It is also much cheaper looking than the rest of the site
1516,"I appreciate the high amount of information that is easily reached, but a few more picture would be nice. ESPN.com is a great example of picture and information dense site."
1516,A lot of really good sites have a slide show here that shows multiple options over time.
1521,this part is too big and the name of the college is too small
1521,name is too small
1521,Font here seems sort of small to read (especially for parents who are older and might not be able to read it as well)
1521,A picture of the campus would be really nice here. there are only two pictures!
1522,"i recommend having different color text to indicate who paid

(ex:red)"
1522,"i recommend having a different color for those who received payment 

(ex:green)"
1524,"Choose colors with higher contrast, the colors blend too much."
1524,"Move the paragraph lower to the bottom, too much ""white space"" below.

Font color should match either the white or beige."
1524,"Move ""Dance"" and ""Open House 2015"" further to the right to make the spacing match the left hand side."
1524,Move the entire line up further.
1524,"Choose a higher quality image here, preferably something vector based."
1524,Same as above -- needs higher contrast.
1524,Should be larger so that the font is somewhat readable -- page is large enough to not have to force items to fit.
1526,I would be confused here as to when I get to choose whether to pay or charge someone.
1526,"Nice, simple nav menu, very clear"
1526,"I don't like these checklists, they pressure me to do more within than app that I may want to"
1529,A picture would make me feel more secure
1530,"Black and Purple is a fine color scheme, but needs to POP more! Perhaps the dancers should be larger!
"
1530,This looks like a cheap photoshop/edit of the outline of the dancers. Lets add something else to the outline to make it pop more!
1531,This icon should be shifted to the right more. There is too much empty space between the icon and the 'open house 2015' text.
1531,Move this block of text down a half an inch. There is too much black space at the bottom.
1532,"This would look better at the bottom.
"
1532,"I would move this to the top.
"
1532,"wasted space
"
1532,i like this section.
1533,This space could probably be better utilized
1533,"Really looks a lot like Facebook's UI, not sure if that was intentional?"
1533,Would be cool if we could see payment history somewhere
1533,"What are people liking, sharing, or tweeting?"
1534,"Maybe a ""switch user"" button?
"
1534,about and contact links go here
1535,the site in general looks very plain.
1535,I'm not sure if you really need to ask friends to come. The ones you need you can just tell them to download.
1535,is there a safety net to who you can send/receive money from?
1535,Kind of weird seeing everyone's business...
1536,"Terrible slogan, makes it sound like a preschool
"
1536,"Similar links to the side menu, two menus seems confusing and redundant"
1537,Too much spacing here
1537,Color doesn't go with rest of page. No text - just blank?
1537,This list should be in reverse order. Newest first.
1537,Text here is too small to read
1537,3rd and 7th.
1538,"Where is this list of friends generated from? Social media, contacts, etc.?
"
1538,"Easy design to follow and read...can this be customized so you can keep certain transactions private?
"
1538,"What is the benefit of sharing the transactions that you make with friends/social networks??
"
1538,"Instagram should probably be here as well, since it's a huge social media platform
"
1538,"Accounts need to be authenticated and verified somehow, similar to PayPal
"
1539,Time/Place should be separated so that it says Time: [the time] and Place [the place]
1539,The bar in the picture should be removed. It seems a bit cluttered.
1539,Circle logo in the upper left corner may look better in this spot here.
1541,"This box needs to be more narrow, the text doesn't even fill it."
1541,Don't like the contrasting font color here. 
1541,This takes up too much space and doesn't seem like it is very important.
1542,add more columns of information too much white space
1542,add more categories up top and possible icons with short cuts 
1542,I like the logo 
1543,Not sure if place is covered with dots? Can't read it.
1543,"Who is performing?
"
1543,"How long is this?
"
1543,"I don't like this design. It doesn't look smooth.
"
1543,This doesn't stand out enough.
1544,"This section would probably benefit from a small calendar of the current month with highlights on dates that can be hovered over to get info.
"
1544,"This seems a little crowded, but on a full screen it might be better."
1544,"I know it's located somewhere in here somewhere, but a section on the types of degrees available should be an upper-level option"
1544,The info on degrees could be here as well
1544,This seems good the way it is
1546,I think it would look better without the gradient here
1546,"Not the best model, no offence"
1546,"Single Row of links, dropdowns for subcategories are better."
1546,What are these 4 things here for?  They look like 4 banner ads why are they here?
1549,Too cluttered
1549,Distracting
1551,unappealing shade of purple
1551,perhaps more distinctness between the two silhouettes - looks kind of blobby right now 
1551,indented for seemingly no reason. maybe use bullet points
1554,"These links should not be red, maybe blue or black would flow better."
1554,This information seems irreverent and is distracting.
1554,"These links should also be a different color. The red/orange hue doesn't flow well and doesn't make me think ""go""."
1554,These links should stand out more with larger font.
1556,Everything looks completely fine to me.. Great site. 
1559,The logo needs to be centered and make it bigger
1559,"lot of unused space.. provide a link to direction and campus map
"
1560,"header/banner is too plain looking and generic
"
1560,A lot of open space.
1560,Resembles Facebook too much without the modern feel.
1569,"You have some extra space here, so you might consider listing the four styles of ballroom dance you'll be teaching."
1569,"It would be nice to know whether registration is required or if you just show up.
"
1571,there is a bit of white in the graphic that should be either purple or black
1571,"the space on this side of the title is larger than the left side of the title, I would make them equal."
1577,I like how every
1577,I like how everything is clearly defined.
1577,Nice picture of a potential student. Could use more text though.
1577,"Informative menu options. Maybe expand the menu a little to include other things like financial aid, student housing, etc."
1577,Nice bulletin that keeps current student informed about major campus activities.
1577,Looks kind of like an advertisement but is not. It just gives that feel. 
1586,"It would be nice to have a location when this poster was printed.  Also, I would less likely ignore this poster if it had bright colors.  No other comments."
1587,"Good picture
"
1587,"Catchy font
"
1587,Good info!
1588,I find it slightly crowded so that there are many aspects of it You do not see at first. I would consider cutting back on some go ahead logos or perhaps using other colors than just shades of green to catch the eye / more for the academics/admissions area. 
1589,"You could list the dances that will be performed.  I think ""tango"" would grab more peoples attention than 4 styles of ballroom dance...boring..."
1589,Do you want to use Dance twice with one word in between?  Couldn't it just be Illini Dance Sport Open House.
1589,"How about a little slit in the dress for design, it would add a little sex appeal."
1590,"This looks like a link, but I'm not sure what it would go to. Maybe a map to get to the campus or something? I think that it could be clearer."
1590,"I like the way the information links are kept together and put in the top left corner, so they're the first things you read. That makes it easy to find what you're looking for."
1590,"I'm not sure I like all the different shades of green, especially the dark green text on a medium green background. It's a little hard on the eyes."
1591,The title needs a change of font to help make it stand out and interesting.
1591,State the styles of ballroom dances that students will be shown.
1591,"The color seems too monotone; maybe to flash more, have each character a different shade, giving more definition in each one."
1591,"Some may need help with a location, so specifics may be needed."
1592,It would be great if there was a price on here
1594,Wonder if there should be a direct link to FAFSA somewhere on here
1597,This text is very small. Could it be enlarged?
1597,There is a lot of green on the page. Maybe use one different color.
1597,"This blank space could be used. Space out the rest of the information on the left side so it doesn't look so ""busy"""
1597,I would like to see the words for this menu larger.
1597,These words are large. I'd rather see more of the photograph.
1600,The gradient in this text box makes the design look a bit amateur-ish.
1600,I feel like the date headings should be larger than the text of the event that they're promoting.
1600,I'm not a big fan of the white space used behind the text. A more appealing background color might help the text pop a bit more.
1601,"I don't really like the ""Coming to Parkland?"" wording, it seems redundant to the Future Students menu option above...perhaps ""Why Parkland?"" leading to a list of great things about Parkland.  "
