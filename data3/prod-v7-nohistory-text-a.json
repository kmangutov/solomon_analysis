The purple would probably be best if it were changed to another color, perhaps somewhere between robin egg blue or teal? If you want to keep a cooler shade that is. A warm shade could also be good, and it'd capture your eye immediately against the dark black background. If you WERE to change the color to something warm, I'd recommend a yellow or an orange, which would also fit well because the date of the event is nearing the end of summer/beginning of fall and orange and yellow are good fall and summer colors.
