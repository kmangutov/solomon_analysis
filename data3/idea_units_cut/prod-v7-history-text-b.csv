Very good design.. Left side bottom blank only.  No any other changes..  I like this work.. 
I like the layout.  I think the color scheme works well.  Personally, I wouldn't change anything on it.  I would put it out there knowing if anything minor tweaks can be made as needed.  It looks to me like it is ready to be released.//Thanks
The menu in the top part should be moved little down atleast the height of the site name.There should be a big banner on the top. The image should be of full width.There is also a left blank area on the left side which should be filled off.Make the text of the menu little bigger.
The green is awful. The image in the center is too big. It almost looks like a website from 2000. Reminds me of SPAM.
I feel there should be home button to come back to main home page.I'm not sure whether the PARKLAND COLLEGE image have the link to comeback to main page.Design looks simple and easy to navigate.
The color green is not good. The image is very large. Instead it can be utilized for some more information to be given.
The bottom left of the page is too cluttered and disorganized. The links are too small to read. Make the links bigger. Make the picture of the smiling student smaller.
I really like the design, but I think you could spread it out with more colors, instead of throwing green everywhere on the page, and maybe don't use the logo and what not so many times over the page, it makes it look busy.
Looks decent, but I'll put "In the news" and "Campus events" beneath informations on the left.
I like the "go Ahead" theme carried through the page.  The color green does go along with "Go", but there is too much of it.  Though it looks like it's a part of your branding, as it's on on the logo. "In the News" and "Campus Events" seem bland compared to rest of page.  Need to spice it up, IMHO. The "As You Like It" ad seems out of place.
The layout is easy to understand and the website seems to be easy to navigate.  I feel that the layout of the web page and the design could be improved.  It seems kind of like a template was used to create the webpage and the same color is used too much.  Try varying the colors and a more unique webpage design to set the website apart from others.
It looks well laid-out and professional. I feel that I'd have no issues navigating the site, as it is very clear. The color is easy on the eyes and catches attention. I think it is great as it is and do not have any suggestions for improvement, but it may be worth stating I have never studied design and love the color green.
The overall look is a little cheap. I really like the "GO AHEAD" logo and I would like to see it incorporated into more of the overall design. The "GO AHEAD" logo style feels fresh and exciting. I would like to see a little less green in the design - perhaps have the shades of green serve as accent colors.
The overall design of the website is very clean and nicely set up. The page is easy to navigate without too much going on. You might want to offer a direct link to maps to visit the college. You also might want to offer a direct hit for employment opportunities on the homepage. I'm not sure if this college offers a specific email opportunity for their current students, but if they do, it might be nice to have a direct link for them to click on and access the web portal. One more suggestion, if you have any facebook, twitter or other media accounts you might want to offer a "stay connected option" at the bottom for people to click on and go directly to seeing your pages.
The page appears to be refreshingly uncluttered. The links are intuitive. I don't feel as though I'd be bumbling around trying to find the relevant information. The colors are pleasing. The font size appears to be adequate for most people to read easily.
The overall color scheme is good, but the gradient on the left side makes it look a bit cheap. I'd also recommend reconsidering the font use in the text; this looks slightly unprofessional. I think there's too much white space in the bottom.
The color scheme really looks rather old. Beige and green looks rather drab, the font choice also looks rather bad. The pictures used on the left side look bad, especially the parkland red one really stands out and looks rather geocities-ish. I would take all navigation on the page and put it toward the top to condense everything.
seems clear and navigable. bottom left (go ahead... need extra...) seems unnecessary, or at least could be replaced with a simple link. The 'Go Ahead >' theme in general seems a bit over done. Also, you might want to add info about student housing available in the area.
there is too much green and very less faces for representing different diversities .
Empty space on bottom left hand side, is not looking good. Purpose of "Go Ahead" on left hand side is defeated when it is already highlighted on the page. Instead, increase the font size of topics under "INFORMATION FOR" and remove the "Go Ahead" on left hand side".  Otherwise good and simple design.
I like the number and organization of the links and having different ways of organizing things, by visitor type on the left, and by subject type on top, while also having a drop-down menu for quicklinks.  I think that the idea behind the design is solid, however, the design comes off a little segmented and boxy.  The idea of listing news and campus events is good, but it feels visually distinct from the rest of the site.  Plus, I don't know what the large center image is referring to, future or current students.  And finally, bottom left box is unnecessary filler and visually distracts from the rest of the design.
It is a good design but i have some suggestions change the theme color green to blue then change the lady in the pic add a cute girl
Good design. I do not have any complaints. 
Site is very well laid out with a clean design that's easy to read, understand and navigate.The text colors come off the background very well and show good readability. I work on sites and I don't really see anything that I would change at all except for the wasted space at the bottom of the left column, make that a dynamic box to end where the widget ends, or use that space for another widget, maybe some social media links because they're important to that age group.
IF YOU VIEW YOUR COLLEGE BUILDING FACILITY THAT IS LAB , CLASSROOM, AND STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM IT WILL BE MORE ATTRACTED.
I like the different shades of green as the main focus color. I also like that there is color contrast, especially how the color of the lettering in the "In the News" and "Campus Events" columns coordinate with the image in the lower left corner. There are issues with that for me though, for some reason, the lettering in that particular color is more difficult to read that the other small lettering. Maybe it should be larger or brighter? To elaborate on the lower left corner, it seems the info that appears to give dates on a Shakespeare performance (hard to read) should be larger-it just makes sense to expand it and fill the empty tan space below it rather than cramping so much info into a too-small space. I also feel like there should be more info on the main page regarding the institute instead of just it's name, ideally a location(s, if applicable), along with pertinent address info and telephone numbers where calls with general questions can be directed and subsequently routed to the correct dept. at the school.
Too much space being taken up by the graphic and not enough interactive elements like a video.  Id make the site have more useful information right away directing people based on what group of people they are.
The overall color and design is good and neat, But it will be more attractive if you choose some dark colors.
very easy to understand and fulfill the needs.Also good look and design.
The website is too greenish. Color should be changed. Font is small. Size of font should be increased. Underlines in the 'In the news' and 'campus events'  sections should be avoided.
