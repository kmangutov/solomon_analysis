The top portion that is in  blue in color can be made broader.
I think its odd that you can follow the financial transactions of your friends. I don't really like that and would not want my friends to just be able to track all the money I'm spending. Thats neat and all but if you can only charge or pay someone if they are signed up it doesn't make sense to use really. A little plain, lots of white space being used. Room for extra information maybe. What is the percentage bar for thatsays getting started? Whats the point of that?
The two buttons that say 'pay' and 'charge' are not catchy because of its color. Both of these can be either the same color or different. I think these buttons being the most important part of the page can be highlighted either with catching colors or attractive button designs.
Friends' comments area has occupied more room of the page. It can be fixed size but make scroll-able content. There would be shown footer giving some more other information.
Next to the names for those that transferred money should be the amount that was transferred. For example, "Tristan paid Stan Brand" should be "Tristan paid Stan Brand $XX.XX. There should also be an icon near the friend's name that denote how much money you transferred to him/her previously, and when that transfer happened.
i t will be good if you add contact that will import from social sites and by improving user interface which will appeal more by bringing animation in the page
I'm not sure a "like" click is necessary for a pay site.  Perhaps I'm not getting this but it looks to be far more social media than a pay site.  I think there are already many forms of social media out there and my first concern with the social atmosphere I see here would be security...are my details being protected.  Why would I want to know who paid who and why would I want anyone else to know who I paid?  The getting started checklist - the green clashes a bit with the blue/gray theme you have going on.  Maybe use a dark blue color for that?  The profile picture is yet another security concern.  On the one hand, it is good to see a photo of who you're dealing with - in this case, friends, but on the other hand, the security concerns outweigh the uniqueness.  
I think it's kind of strange that everyone can see what everyone is paying each other in this app/site. Are some of the transactions private? This site is usable, but I'm not sure if there's a huge audience for people who want others to see their transactions. I think having a checklist of who you owe money to would be important rather than a "PAY" button in which you have to enter a name into. It's very necessary to have a list of who owes you what and who you owe. I also think it'd be nice to have a button in which you can add notes to people. For instance, you can write down who they are if they are just an acquaintance, or you're looking to charge them for something in the future you've already done for them. Good and simple layout though. 
The design is a little boring. It does not draw my attention to the screen. I think some of the buttons should be in a color other than blue or white like the bar at the top of the screen. The page itself should be in a color other than white. It seems to be a bit distracting and unable to follow.
I don't think a person needs to know all the transactions between friends. The app should show only what a person pays or charges, that is, only their personal transactions.  Also, the app needs more colors other than blue and white. It looks a little bland and uninteresting.
The design is visually boring. It appears that the comments are a chance for folks to interact instead of talking with one another on the phone. Not sure if this feature is really necessary. I would like to see some information on this page about how the money transfers/users' information is kept secure. I might also like a chart or table that shows money transfers, as opposed to a running list of prose; it looks kind of like facebook. Other than that, it's an intriguing service. 
The comment interface looks too generic. It looks like spam.
The lay out is pretty basic. Maybe try adding some more color to the site. It would be best if there was a couple of default avatars for users. I don't know if it's set to that one avatar just as a placement but I wouldn't use that avatar on the actual site. The check list section should maybe be actual boxes that are checked off inside of a sliding scale like you have here. Other than that I am okay with the way this page is set up.
There is a lack of privacy.  It looks too much like Facebook's interface.  I'm worried about the site being used for illegal purposes.
I think its not a good practice that our friends can see my financial transaction. I wouldn't want my friends to see my financial transactions.
simple sleek design looks easy enough to use to transfer money
The design looks very much professional and attractive. The navigation is also very simple. The design is already very good and there is no need for improvement.
Clean design and I do enjoy the colors. However, it does look a bit Facebook-ish to me. I think the Like button is redundant. Making the Public, Friends, and Mine buttons more visible. I also wouldn't want my other friends to know about my transactions. Are there options for privacy?
Clean design, but Public, Friends, and Mine buttons could be more visible. It looks too similar to Facebook. Omitting the Like button would help. I also wonder if there are privacy options, because I would not want my other friends to see my transactions.
I feel the design is basic, maybe too basic. I think some more colorful or interesting graphics would make this plain page look more inviting.
It looks very boring, the color scheme is dull and there's no sense of interactivity.
black colors to be changed to multi colors
The design looks simple and easy to understand. The pay/charge options at the top center is convenient and allows easy access to the most important feature. There seems to be a lot of empty space to the right of the list of friends' payments that seems a little distracting, maybe the table could be shrunk or the size of each item could be increased (text size, image size, etc?). There don't seem to be any buttons to 'send' things (ie it looks like comments are submitted by typing the comment then hitting enter) which might confuse some users who are less tech savvy than others. It's difficult to comment on the design of the pay/charge buttons without a working demo but the critique is the same. Overall this is a straightforward and well designed page.
I'd much rather have a date and time stamp showing when payment was sent, versus the social media style of "30 minutes ago," "2 days ago" etc. It comes across as unprofessional and makes it harder to track. 
The default avatar seems a bit dark. It could be lighter, possibly with more color. The Pay and Charge buttons would stand out more if they had bright colors.
Make sure there is some way to make the payment transfers hidden so that you don't automatically show everyone who you are giving money to.
This application looks like just chat application,there is no way one can determine how trusted this application to deal with monetary transactions in a secure way,how safe it is?there should some information how many successful transactions have completed until now in a secure manner.There should be some trusted symbol or verified by some agency to give authorization,trust and about safety to people who want to do monetary transaction. 
I actually use venmo and absolutely love it. I don't think anything needs to be changed. Maybe change the blue in the names to a little darker
Maybe the amount transferred should be listed in the timeline displayed on this page. Although I guess this is showing transfers between people that is not the user logged in, so I guess that wouldn't make sense. It is a little too close to Facebook. Maybe something should be done to distinguish it. It may look better without the borders around the timeline. 
I like the over all design but I would like to see a bit more variation in color and font sizes or styles.   It is rather plain in a bad way.   And, I am not sure if this is supposed to be a donation site or a money transfer site more akin to Western Union.   But, I am not sure I would like a facebook style wall to communicate with friends about borrowing or giving money.    I think there would need to be a greater degree of privacy and security.
