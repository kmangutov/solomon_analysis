The design is very p lain but eye-catching. However, I do not really like the use of space and feel that the picture could be framed in a border. Underneath the "Join us..." task, there is a very poor use of blank space; you could maybe use a different, bigger font, add more logos or anything. Above the name of "Illini Dancesport" is a lot of blank space, as well I feel
I like the design but would make a few changes primarily to the fonts.  I would move the "Join us ...." portion down on the page a little bit and make the font about 20 percent bigger. Also, I would consider making the date and time a different color. It does not catch my eye as it stands now and I feel like I really have to search for it. 
Alittle more information would be nice. Is this to get students for a dance class? How long does it last? what is the attire? are there refreshments?
I like the background being black and it offsets the fonts well. White might be a better choice for most of the lettering, rather than yellow, and with a change to the to the size of the fonts to make them larger. I think you may need a little more detail on the dress requirements, and what is included for the open house (meet so and so, have refreshments, etc. to entice people to show up! 
The overall design is very good and to attractive.Its background design and font is so good .Overall no need for the improvement
I LIKE THE SIMPLISITY BUT THECOLORS SEEM DRAB TO ME I AM NOT A FAN OF THE PURPLE CLIP ART
Could have used some lively colors that would spark once excitement. The black background and the other colors used is too dull.
The silhouette of the man and woman dancing is a little difficult to figure out, so I would use a different graphic.  The colors don't seem to harmonize so I would use a different contrast color than the violet.  Don't Italicize everything in the last paragraph.
I think it's a fine flyer, very straight forward, very direct. The title portion could be a bit larger and maybe you could do something to make a date time and location a bit more prominent. 
The background color is fully black and may change that color which is pleasing. Some decorations to be filled with music instruments and other things which related to the dance show which could exaggerate the advertisement better.
I like the silhouette design.  I think there is too much empty space for the image, maybe raise the dancers below the title.
The color purple makes me think Northwestern, not UofI.  I think you should use orange for school spirit.    Otherwise, I like the overall design.  I think the silhouette of the dancers could refined.  I can see some residual white edges around the purple.   I would move the block of text starting with "join us..." down a little bit so its more evenly spaced between the text above and the bottom of the poster.
The font color in the bottom being grey is a little difficult to read, also using numbers instead of words looks a little tacky. The font used is too stock, and the photo is too clipart. I think spending a little more and having a better artist illustrate something unique will be more captivating.  
I don't like the font it is too stale and dates.  Also the yellow color on the font is gross.  I like the sillouhettes, but not really a fan of the color.  I think red would be better.
I like the header, and the silhouette of the dancers is well done, too. But I think the text on the left-hand side should align better, everything just appears to float independently, which I know is intentional, but in this case, it doesn't look quite right. If it were up to me, I'd make the poster narrower, and place the location and description as a more compact single column.
The clip art figures are just bad, you could easily put a quality photo in that space. Lot of black negative space and the grey text on the black background on the lower right doesn't pop out or catch the eye at all, and the tan letters aren't much better on a black background. Looks like something cheap and from the early 90's design era.
The writings are very formal.Putting some emoji would help.background color and the couple color does not blend well.
I like the logo at the top. The font for it is really nice, as is the spacing of the words but I don't like the space between the very top of the image and the beginning of the logo. I also feel as if there is too much space between the end of the text and bottom of the image. The art in the image is nice and I like the colors, it does have some strange white spots on it, though.
i don't like this background color so try to change the color
I like that it is simple but I feel it would work better if the colors contrasted each other in a better fashion. Perhaps use one brighter or livelier color? I also felt the details under time/place would look better if it was aligned to the left and maybe boldened.   
The content of the letters and font should me improved otherwise it is cool and simple.
the background should be little more colourful and can apply little more design also.
color of the text should be bright. Background color also to be changed, but not black
I think the ad should be of real people. It should be more fun and colorful too to show how fun dance can be
I don't care for the graphic of the two people dancing, it seems too amateur for me. It isn't a good pic in silhouette. Also, the date and time should be much bigger so it catches peoples attention right away. Also, the word "Ballroom" should be more prominently featured in the Header, or Title of this poster. 
I really like this design. There's only two minor things that I'd adjust and fix. For starters, there's specs of white in the purple that are unattractive & really stand out against the perfectly smooth, black background. I'd also choose a lighter shade of grey for the "Join us for an evening of..." section to make it better stand out in poorly lit areas or students with difficulty seeing (for any reason.) Possibly even a lighter shade of purple to compliment the art & "DANCE"? 
This is decent.  The colors do pop and it's  simple. 
I like the top half. It's easy to read and eye-pleasing. The follow text on the right side, bottom half could be better placed. The text choice makes it look amatuer-ish. I would pick and stick with one font for the information.   The silhouettes is a bit messy, you can see where the poor clipping is, the edges that show some white. It should be better cleaned up.  I like the color scheme, the light purple and yellow.  
It is very simple and very nice. I like how the dancers stand out. They are in motion and the color is very nice also.
The design is fine but the picture of the dancing people looks low quality and weird with all the white spots on it, it should be cleaned up. Also more information might be helpful.
