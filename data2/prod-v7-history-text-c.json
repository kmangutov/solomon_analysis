I think some of the buttons should be in a color other than blue or white like the bar at the top of the screen. The page itself should be in a color other than white. It seems to be a bit distracting and unable to follow.","id":8,"show":[],"hide":[],"history":[],"duration":0},{"val":"I don't think a person needs to know all the transactions between friends. The app should show only what a person pays or charges, that is, only their personal transactions. \nAlso, the app needs more colors other than blue and white. It looks a little bland and uninteresting.","id":9,"show":[],"hide":[],"history":[],"duration":0},{"val":"The design is visually boring. It appears that the comments are a chance for folks to interact instead of talking with one another on the phone. Not sure if this feature is really necessary. I would like to see some information on this page about how the money transfers/users' information is kept secure. I might also like a chart or table that shows money transfers, as opposed to a running list of prose; it looks kind of like facebook. Other than that, it's an intriguing service.

It looks like spam.","id":11,"show":[],"hide":[],"history":[],"duration":0},{"val":"The lay out is pretty basic. Maybe try adding some more color to the site. It would be best if there was a couple of default avatars for users. I don't know if it's set to that one avatar just as a placement but I wouldn't use that avatar on the actual site. The check list section should maybe be actual boxes that are checked off inside of a sliding scale like you have here. Other than that I am okay with the way this page is set up.","id":12,"show":[],"hide":[],"history":[],"duration":0},{"val":"There is a lack of privacy.  It looks too much like Facebook's interface.

Are there options for privacy?","id":17,"show":[],"hide":[],"history":[],"duration":0},{"val":"Clean design, but Public, Friends, and Mine buttons could be more visible. It looks too similar to Facebook. Omitting the Like button would help.
